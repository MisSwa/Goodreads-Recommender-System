As Rumi said, ""Love will find its way through all languages on its own""; in 'teaching my mother how to give birth', Warsan's debut pamphlet, we witness the unearthing of a poet who finds her way through all preconceptions to strike the heart directly. Warsan Shire is a Kenyan-born Somali poet and writer who is based in London. Born in 1988, she is an artist and activist who uses her work to document narratives of journey and trauma.

The collection reveals the sweeping compass of Swenson's curiosity: nature poems display her keen observation of wildlife; exuberant and erotic love poems celebrate beauty and passion; place poems record her travels to the American Southwest, France, and Italy and her residence in New York City and Sea Cliff, Long Island; verse ""analyses"" investigate baseball, wave motion, the DNA molecule, bronco busting, James Bond movies, and the first walk on the moon. Swenson was an inveterate reviser: poems in earlier volumes were frequently reworked for inclusion in later volumes, such as To Mix with Time (1963) and New and Selected Things Taking Place (1978).

11517452,4,US,true,3.96,"In this first adult novel by the New York Times bestselling author of the unforgettable Crank trilogy, three female friends face midlife crisis in a no holds-barred exploration of sex, marriage, and the fragility of life.
Ellen Hopkins has made her mark as the wildly popular author of several novels for young adults--every one of them a New York Timesbestseller, and every one a hard-hitting exploration of tough-to-tackle topics. Now, in Triangles, Hopkins brings her storytelling mastery and fearlessness to take on the challenges of adult dramas.
In this emotionally powerful novel, three women face the age-old midlife question: If I'm halfway to death, is this all I've got to show for it? Holly, filled with regret for being a stay-at-home mom, sheds sixty pounds and loses herself in the world of extramarital sex. Andrea, a single mom and avowed celibate, watches her friend Holly's meltdown with a mixture of concern and contempt. Holly is throwing away what Andrea has spent her whole life searching for--a committed relationship with a decent guy. So what if Andrea picks up Holly's castaway husband? Then there's Marissa. She has more than her fair share of challenges--a gay teenage son, a terminally ill daughter, and a husband who buries himself in his work rather than face the facts. As one woman's marriage unravels, another one's rekindles. As one woman's family comes apart at the seams, another's is reconfigured into something bigger and better. In this story of connections and disconnections, one woman's up is another one's down, and all three of them will learn the meaning of friendship, betrayal, and forgiveness before it is through.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11517452-triangles,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11517452-triangles,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309672946m/11517452.jpg,14,15709019,Triangles,Triangles

The Gita opens dramatically, with prince Arjuna collapsing in anguish on the brink of a war that he doesnOCOt want to fight. Arjuna has lost his way on the battlefield of life, and turns to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, the Lord himself. Krishna replies in 700 verses of sublime instruction on living and dying, loving and working, and the nature of the soul.
This book includes an extensive and very readable introduction, which places the Gita in its historical setting, explains the key concepts, and brings out the universality of its teachings. Individual chapter introductions prepare the reader for the main themes, and notes, a Sanskrit glossary, and an index are included.
Although the battlefield is a perfect backdrop, for Easwaran the GitaOCOs subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage. ArjunaOCOs dilemma is acutely modern, and the GitaOCOs message remains as relevant for us now as it was for ancient India.

Yeats (1865-1939) is best known for his poetry, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923, the first Irish writer so honored.
Yeats was born and educated in Dublin, studying poetry in his youth. From an early age he was fascinated by both Irish legends and the occult. Those topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the century. His earliest volume of poetry was published in 1889. Yeats was also an important figure in the Irish Literary Revival, and a fervent Irish nationalist as well.

His enemies: slackers and hypocrites. His mission: to steel your soul and rock your world.""
Rollins was frontman for the seminal punk band Black Flag, and since 1987 has led the Rollins Band, whose ninth album, Come In and Burn, was just released by DreamWorks.
As a spoken-word artist, he regularly performs at colleges and theaters worldwide and has released eight spoken-word audiotapes. His album Get in the Vanwon the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album for 1995. As an actor, he has appeared in The Chase, Johnny Mnemonic, Heat, and David Lynch's forthcoming film, Lost Highway.
From his days as front man for the band Black Flag and the current Rollins Band to his books and spoken-word audiotapes, Henry Rollins is the music, the attitude, and the voice that takes no prisoners. In his twelve books, he has led us on a hallucinatory journey through the decades--and his mind--with poems, essays, short stories, diary entries, and rants that exist at ""the frayed edges where reality ends and imagination begins"" (Publishers Weekly).

In this collection of sixty-six poems, Stevenson recalls the joys of his childhood, from sailing boats down a river, to waiting for the lamplighter, to sailing off to foreign lands in his imagination.

""Jones is the kind of writer who s more than wanted: he s desperately needed.""FlavorWire
""I get shout-happy when I read these poems; they are the gospel; they are the good news of the sustaining power of imagination, tenderness, and outright joy.""D. A. Powell
Prelude to Bruise works its tempestuous mojo just under the skin, wreaking a sweet havoc and rearranging the pulse. These poems don't dole out mercy. Mr. Jones undoubtedly dipped his pen in fierce before crafting these stanzas that rock like backslap. Straighten your skirt, children. The doors of the church are open. Patricia Smith
It s a big book, a major book. A game-changer. Dazzling, brutal, real. Not just brilliant, caustic, and impassioned but a work that brings historyin which the personal and political are inter-constitutiveto the immediate moment. Jones takes a reader deep into lived experience, into a charged world divided among unstable yet entrenched lines: racial, gendered, political, sexual, familial. Here we absorb each quiet resistance, each whoop of joy, a knowledge of violence and of desire, an unbearable ache/loss/yearning. This is not just a new voice but a new song, a new way of singing, a new music made of deep grief s wildfire, of burning intelligence and of all-feeling heart, scorched and seared. In a poem, Jones says, Boy s body is a song only he can hear. But now that we have this book, we can all hear it. And it s unforgettable. Brenda Shaughnessy
Inside each hunger, each desire, speaks the voice of a boy that admits I ve always wanted to be dangerous. This is not a threat but a promise to break away from the affliction of silence, to make audible the stories that trouble the dimensions of masculinity and discomfort the polite conversations about race. With impressive grace, Saeed Jones situates the queer black body at the center, where his visibility and vulnerability nurture emotional strength and the irrepressible energy to claim those spaces that were once denied or withheld from him. Prelude to a Bruise is a daring debut. Rigoberto Gonzalez
From ""Sleeping Arrangement"": 
Take your hand out

8747034,1,US,true,4.31,"This is the most comprehensive English translation of the work of Gunter Eich, one of the greatest postwar German poets. The author of the POW poem ""Inventory,"" among one of the most famous lyrics in the German language, Eich was rivaled only by Paul Celan as the leading poet in the generation after Gottfried Benn and Bertolt Brecht. Expertly translated and introduced by Michael Hofmann, this collection gathers eighty poems, many drawn from Eich's later work and most of them translated here for the first time. The volume also includes the original German texts on facing pages.
As an early member of ""Gruppe 47"" (from which Gunter Grass and Heinrich Boll later shot to prominence), Eich (1907-72) was at the vanguard of an effort to restore German as a language for poetry after the vitriol, propaganda, and lies of the Third Reich. Short and clear, these are timeless poems in which the ominousness of fairy tales meets the delicacy and suggestiveness of Far Eastern poetry. In his late poems, he writes frequently, movingly, and often wryly of infirmity and illness. ""To my mind,"" Hofmann writes, ""there's something in Eich of Paul Klee's pictures: both are homemade, modest in scale, immediately delightful, inventive, cogent.""

A brilliant new collection from the Forward Prize winning poet
Charged with strangeness and beauty, Hill of Doors is a haunted and haunting book, where each successive poem seems a shape conjured from the shadows, and where the uncanny is made physically present. The collection sees the return of some familiar members of the Robertson company, including Strindberg - heading, as usual, towards calamity - and the shape-shifter Dionysus. Four loose retellings of stories of the Greek god form pillars for the book, alongside four short Ovid versions. Threaded through these are a series of pieces about the poet's childhood on the north-east coast, his fascination with the sea and the islands of Scotland. However, the reader will also discover a distinct new note in Robertson's austere but ravishing poetry: towards the possibility of contentment - a house, a door, a key - finding, at last, a 'happiness of the hand and heart'. Magisterial in its command and range, indelibly moving and memorable in its speech, Hill of Doors is Robin Robertson's most powerful book to date.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17352796-hill-of-doors,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17352796-hill-of-doors,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433839548m/17352796.jpg,15,24095365,Hill of Doors,Hill of Doors

New poetry by the award-winning poet Tracy K. Smith, whose ""lyric brilliance and political impulses never falter"" (Publishers Weekly, starred review)
You lie there kicking like a baby, waiting for God himself
To lift you past the rungs of your crib. What
Would your life say if it could talk?
--from ""No Fly Zone""
With allusions to David Bowie and interplanetary travel, Life on Mars imagines a soundtrack for the universe to accompany the discoveries, failures, and oddities of human existence. In these brilliant new poems, Tracy K. Smith envisions a sci-fi future sucked clean of any real dangers, contemplates the dark matter that keeps people both close and distant, and revisits the kitschy concepts like ""love"" and ""illness"" now relegated to the Museum of Obsolescence. These poems reveal the realities of life lived here, on the ground, where a daughter is imprisoned in the basement by her own father, where celebrities and pop stars walk among us, and where the poet herself loses her father, one of the engineers who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope. With this remarkable third collection, Smith establishes herself among the best poets of her generation.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34442595-life-on-mars,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34442595-life-on-mars,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,14,14527177,Life on Mars: Poems,Life on Mars: Poems

During an unexplained fainting spell, Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac experienced a flash of enlightenment. A student of Buddhist philosophy, Kerouac recognized the experience as ""satori,"" a moment of life-changing epiphany. The knowledge he gained in that instant is expressed in this volume of sixty-six prose poems with language that is both precise and cryptic, mystical and plain. His vision proclaims, ""There are not two of us here, reader and writer, but one golden eternity.""
Within these meditations, haikus, and Zen koans is a contemplation of consciousness and impermanence. While heavily influenced by the form of Buddhist poems or sutras, Kerouac also draws inspiration from a variety of religious traditions, including Taoism, Native American spirituality, and the Catholicism of his youth.

Pilgrims on their way to worship at the shrine of Saint Thomas a Becket in Canterbury stop at the Tabard Inn. Representing a cross-section of medieval English society, the group includes a knight and his squire, a prioress, a friar, a miller, and a wife. To amuse themselves on their journey, they agree that each will tell a tale. These stories - by turns bawdy, hilarious, scurrilous, romantic, heroic, and moving - reveal a great deal about the tellers and the world they live in, which, despite the distance of six hundred years, seems remarkably like our own. Indeed, the structure of The Canterbury Talesand the sophisticated, intricate interplay between the stories, their narrators, and the general narrator (himself a complex comic character) give the book its strikingly modern flavor. Often called the first book of poetry written in English, Chaucer's masterpiece is also the first anthology of English short fiction, one that will resonate with readers for as long as folly and courage, deceit and generosity, love and jealousy remain part of the human personality. Robert W. Hanning is Professor of English at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1961. He has published The Vision of History in Early Britain, The Individual in Twelfth-Century Romance, The Lais of Marie de France(co-translated with Joan Ferrante), and Castiglione: the Ideal and the Real in Renaissance Culture(co-edited with David Rosand), as well as many articles on Chaucer's poetry and other medieval and Renaissance subjects.

10364457,1,US,true,4.28,"This celebratory volume gives us the entire career of Donald Justice between two covers, including a rich handful of poems written since New and Selected Poemswas published in 1995. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Justice has been hailed by his contemporary Anthony Hecht as ""the supreme heir of Wallace Stevens."" In poems that embrace the past, its terrors and reconciliations, Justice has become our poet of living memory. The classic American melancholy in his titles calls forth the tenor of our collective passages: ""Bus Stop,"" ""Men at Forty,"" ""Dance Lessons of the Thirties,"" ""The Small White Churches of the Small White Towns."" This master of classical form has found in the American scene, and in the American tongue, all those virtues of our literature and landscape sought by Emerson and Henry James. For half a century he has endeavored, with painterly vividness and plainspoken elegance, to make those local views part of the literary heritage from which he has so often taken solace, and inspiration.
School Letting Out
(Fourth or Fifth Grade)
The afternoons of going home from school
Past the young fruit trees and the winter flowers.
The schoolyard cries fading behind you then,
And small boys running to catch up, as though
It were an honor somehow to be near--
All is forgiven now, even the dogs,
Who, straining at their tethers, used to bark,
Not from anger but some secret joy.

""Scholars and theologians have been discussing the function and power of Biblical language for much of the last hundred years. Some have called for a de-mythologizing of how we understand Scripture, so that the original power and glory of the language of God can be experienced, renewing our awe and wonder. During this time, it has fallen to poets to try to craft this new language, to de-mytholgize texts with thousands of years of dogma and interpretation behind them. Into that fray wades Katie Manning. With clever excisions and deft lineation, Manning reinvigorates our understanding, our sense of what might be happening in those passages we know can't be as simple as we hear every Sunday. From 'The Book of Verbs': 'listen / my womb // do not spend your strength / on kings // it is not for kings // crave / and / let / be.' Breathing new life into Scriptural language, finding the poetry within, is no easy task. Manning shows us a way, a vast, gorgeous poetry within those words we think we know.""

The actual beauty of life exists in the small gaps of silence where we contain our real emotions.
I am not ashamed of my feelings. I am not afraid of other people's opinions of my emotions. I have learnt that, my words healed someone's wounds. It was a ray of hope, motivation for them. I believe words have power and with this power i want to show that i can make a difference. I may not be good at my writing but who was ever good at writing feelings down?
This book is for people who really want to make that effort to understand. Only a person who truly wants to understand can appreciate what i want to say, or they will just find faults in what i want to truly say.

23507401,16,US,true,3.38,"A bold, striking new collection of poems from one of America's most influential and inventive poets.
With more than twenty poetry collections to his name, John Ashbery is one of our most agile, philosophically complex, and visionary poets. In Breezeway, Ashbery's powers of observation are at their most astute; his insight at its most penetrating. Demonstrating his extraordinary command of language and his ability to move fluidly and elegantly between wide-ranging thoughts and ideas--from the irreverent and slyly humorous to the tender, the sad, and the heartbreaking--Ashbery shows that he is a virtuoso fluent in diverse styles and tones of language, from the chatty and whimsical to the lyrical and urbane. Filled with allusions to literature and art, as well as to the absurdities and delights of the everyday world around us, Ashbery's poems are haunting, surprising, hilarious, and knowing all at once, the work of a master craftsman with a keen understanding of the age in which he lives and writes, an age whose fears and fragmentation he conjures and critiques with humor, pathos, and a provocative wit.
Vital and imaginative, Ashbery's poems not only touch on the ""big questions"" and crises of life in the twenty-first century, but also delicately capture the small moments between and among people. Imaginative, linguistically dazzling, and artistically ambitious, Breezewayis John Ashbery's sharpest and most arresting collection yet.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507401-breezeway,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507401-breezeway,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420790844m/23507401.jpg,68,43111535,Breezeway: New Poems,Breezeway: New Poems

He wrote all his poems between the ages of about 15 and 21, after which he turned his back on family, friends, and France to roam the world. In his final years he was a trader in the Horn of Africa. Out of the brief, colourful life and the poetry of sensory wildness has been created the myth of Rimbaud, an enduring icon of youth, rebellion, and freedom. But behind the myth lies a poetic adventure of high ambition and painful rigour, poignant yet heroic.

Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child's soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson's eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.

10204618,1,US,true,4.23,"Sassoon, who lived through World War One and who died in 1967, was, as the introduction to this book tells us, irritated in his later years at always being thought of as a ""war poet"". Understandable perhaps from the point of view of the poet: readers on the other hand might wish to demur. The poems gathered here and chronologically ordered, thereby tracing the course of the war, are an extraordinary testimony to the almost unimaginable experiences of a combatant in that bitter conflict. Moving from the patriotic optimism of the first few poems ("" ... fighting for our freedom, we are free"") to the anguish and anger of the later work (where ""hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists / Flounders in mud ... ""), there comes a point when the reality of trench-warfare and its aftershocks move beyond comprehension: Sassoon knows this, and it becomes a powerful element in his art. As a book, the images have a cumulative relentlessness that make it almost impossible to read more than a few poems in one sitting. Unlike the avant-garde experiments developing in Europe in the first decades of this century, Sassoon's verse is formally conservative--but this was perhaps necessary, for as one reads the poems, one feels that the form, the classically inflected tropes, the metre and rhyme, apart from ironising the rhetoric of glory and battle were necessary techniques for containing the emotion (and indeed, a tone of barely controlled irony may have been the only means by which these angry observations would have been considered publishable at the time). When Sassoon's line begins to fragment, as it does in several of the later poems, it is under the extreme pressure to express the inexpressible. Compassion and sympathy are omnipresent here, in their full etymological sense of suffering with or alongside others--something the higher echelons of command (those "" ... old men who died / Slow, natural deaths--old men with ugly souls"") were never able or willing to contemplate. But Sassoon intuited the future of warfare, could sense that this was not ""the war to end all wars"": the mock-religious invocation of the final poem prefigures the vicious euphemisms of more recent conflicts: ""Grant us the power to prove, by poison gases, / The needlessness of shedding human blood."" Sassoon's bile-black irony signals a deep-felt pessimism: it was with good reason. --Burhan Tufail",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10204618-the-war-poems-of-siegfried-sassoon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10204618-the-war-poems-of-siegfried-sassoon,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,1,1885129,The war poems of Siegfried Sassoon,The war poems of Siegfried Sassoon

8461909,2,US,true,3.79,"Donald Hall's remarkable life in poetry -- a career capped by his appointment as U.S. poet laureate in 2006 -- comes alive in this richly detailed, self-revealing memoir.
Hall's invaluable record of the making of a poet begins with his childhood in Depression-era suburban Connecticut, where he first realized poetry was ""secret, dangerous, wicked, and delicious,"" and ends with what he calls ""the planet of antiquity,"" a time of life dramatically punctuated by his appointment as poet laureate of the United States.
Hall writes eloquently of the poetry and books that moved and formed him as a child and young man, and of adolescent efforts at poetry writing -- an endeavor he wryly describes as more hormonal than artistic. His painful formative days at Exeter, where he was sent like a naive lamb to a high WASP academic slaughter, are followed by a poetic self-liberation of sorts at Harvard. Here he rubs elbows with Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, and Edward Gorey, and begins lifelong friendships with Robert Bly, Adrienne Rich, and George Plimpton. After Harvard, Hall is off to Oxford, where the high spirits and rampant poetry careerism of the postwar university scene are brilliantly captured.
At eighty, Hall is as painstakingly honest about his failures and low points as a poet, writer, lover, and father as he is about his successes, making Unpacking the Boxes -- his first book since being named poet laureate -- both revelatory and tremendously poignant.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8461909-unpacking-the-boxes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8461909-unpacking-the-boxes,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421710779m/8461909.jpg,2,3440622,Unpacking the Boxes: A Memoir of a Life in Poetry,Unpacking the Boxes: A Memoir of a Life in Poetry

Kalevala merkitsi kaannetta suomenkieliselle kulttuurille ja heratti huomiota myos ulkomailla. Se synnytti suomalaisten keskuudessa itseluottamusta oman kielen ja kulttuurin mahdollisuuksiin. Kalevalaa ruvettiin kutsumaan suomalaisten kansalliseepokseksi.
Lonnrot ystavineen jatkoi edelleen kansanrunojen keraamista. Uutta aineistoa kertyi runsaasti. Sen pohjalta Lonnrot julkaisi Kalevalan toisen, laajemman version vuonna 1849. Eepoksessa oli nyt 50 runoa (22 000 saetta) ja se oli juonenkulultaan yhtenaisempi kuin vanha Kalevala.
Vuoden 1849 Kalevala on se, jota siita lahtien on Suomessa luettu ja johon myos useimmat kaannokset pohjautuvat.

'When I became a bird, Lord, nothing could not stop me...'
In Black Country, Liz Berry takes flight: to Wrens Nest, Gosty Hill, Tipton-on-Cut; to the places of home. The poems move from the magic of childhood - bostin fittle at Nanny's, summers before school - into deeper, darker territory: sensual love, enchanted weddings, and the promise of new life.
In Berry's hands, the ordinary is transformed: her characters shift shapes, her eye is unusual, her ear attuned to the sounds of the Black Country, with 'vowels ferrous as nails, consonants / you could lick the coal from.'

Her works range from short lyric love poetry to longer, more complex cycles, such as Requiem, a tragic depiction of the Stalinist terror. One of the forefront leaders of the Acmeism movement, which focused on rigorous form and directness of words, she was a master of conveying raw emotion in her portrayals of everyday situations. During the time of heavy censorship and persecution, her poetry gave voice to the Russian people.
Anna Akhmatova published the collection ""White Flock"" in 1917. Joseph Brodsky later described this volume as writing of personal lyricism tinged with the ""note of controlled terror.""

In this candid, thoroughly engaging book, Alan Bennett creates a unique anthology of works by six well-loved poets. Freely admitting his own youthful bafflement with poetry, Bennett reassures us that the poets and poems in this volume are not only accessible but also highly enjoyable. He then proceeds to prove irresistibly that this is so.
Bennett selects more than seventy poems by Thomas Hardy, A. E. Housman, John Betjeman, W. H. Auden, Louis MacNeice, and Philip Larkin. He peppers his discussion of these writers and their verse with anecdotes, shrewd appraisal, and telling biographical detail: Hardy lyrically recalls his first wife, Emma, in his poetry, although he treated her shabbily in real life. The fabled Auden was a formidable and off-putting figure at the lectern. Larkin, hoping to subvert snooping biographers, ordered personal papers shredded upon his death.

Interview with the authors:
Q: What makes this collection so special?
Bruce Boston: ""Visions of the Mutant Rain Forest was written by the first two Grandmasters of the Science Fiction Poetry Association. It was more than twenty-years in the making.""
Q: How did you two come up with the idea for this science fiction epic?
Robert Frazier: ""In the mid-eighties, Bruce asked me for a story for Berkeley Poets Cooperative. I sent him a cautionary tale of a mutated creature from the waters of the Amazon. He liked the milieu: mutation and the jungle. I had previously explored their collision in two poems for Asimov's SF and Amazing Stories, but Bruce insisted there were rich poetic possibilities still to be mined. Soon we were trading stanzas to 'Return to the Mutant Rain Forest,' which proved to have considerable legs, and, more importantly, became the kick-start to a growing series.""

23213841,14,US,true,4.25,"An impassioned call for a return to reading poetry and an incisive argument for poetry's accessibility to all readers, by critically acclaimed poet Matthew Zapruder
In Why Poetry, award-winning poet Matthew Zapruder takes on what it is that poetry--and poetry alone--can do. Zapruder argues that the way we have been taught to read poetry is the very thing that prevents us from enjoying it. In lively, lilting prose, he shows us how that misunderstanding interferes with our direct experience of poetry and creates the sense of confusion or inadequacy that many of us feel when faced with it.
Zapruder explores what poems are, and how we can read them, so that we can, as Whitman wrote, ""possess the origin of all poems,"" without the aid of any teacher or expert. Most important, he asks how reading poetry can help us to lead our lives with greater meaning and purpose.
Anchored in poetic analysis and steered through Zapruder's personal experience of coming to the form, Why Poetry is engaging and conversational, even as it makes a passionate argument for the necessity of poetry in an age when information is constantly being mistaken for knowledge. While he provides a simple reading method for approaching poems and illuminates concepts like associative movement, metaphor, and negative capability, Zapruder explicitly confronts the obstacles that readers face when they encounter poetry to show us that poetry can be read, and enjoyed, by anyone.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23213841-why-poetry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23213841-why-poetry,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1507060080m/23213841.jpg,61,42756259,Why Poetry,Why Poetry

19194764,1,US,true,4.06,"Renowned critic and poet Clive James presents the crowning achievement of his career: a monumental translation of Dante's The Divine Comedy. The Divine Comedyis the precursor of modern literature, and Clive James's new translation - his life's work and decades in the making - presents Dante's entire epic poem in a single song.
While many poets and translators have attempted to capture the full glory of The Divine Comedyin English, many have fallen short, according to Clive James. Victorian verse translations established an unfortunate tradition of reproducing the sprightly rhyming measures of Dante but at the same time betraying the strain on the translator's powers of invention. For Dante, the dramatic human stories of Hell were exciting, but the spiritual studies of Purgatory and the sublime panoramas of Heaven were no less so.
In this incantatory new translation, James - defying the convention by writing in quatrains - tackles these problems head-on and creates a striking and hugely accessible translation that gives us The Divine Comedyas a whole, unified, and dramatic work.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19194764-the-divine-comedy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19194764-the-divine-comedy,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,8,809248,The Divine Comedy,The Divine Comedy
26833509,4,US,true,4.28,"A stunning poetry debut: this meditation on the black female figure throughout time introduces us to a brave and penetrating new voice.
Robin Coste Lewis's electrifying collection is a triptych that begins and ends with lyric poems considering the roles desire and race play in the construction of the self. The central panel is the title poem, ""Voyage of the Sable Venus,"" a riveting narrative made up entirely of titles of artworks from ancient times to the present--titles that feature or in some way comment on the black female figure in Western art. Bracketed by Lewis's autobiographical poems, ""Voyage"" is a tender and shocking study of the fragmentary mysteries of stereotype, as it juxtaposes our names for things with what we actually see and know. Offering a new understanding of biography and the self, this collection questions just where, historically, do ideas about the black female figure truly begin--five hundred years ago, five thousand, or even longer? And what role has art played in this ancient, often heinous story? From the ""Young Black Female Carrying / a Perfume Vase"" to a ""Little Brown Girl / Girl Standing in a Tree / First Day of Voluntary / School Integration,"" this poet adores her culture and the beauty to be found within it. Yet she is also a cultural critic alert to the nuances of race and desire and how they define us all, including herself, as she explores her own sometimes painful history. Lewis's book is a thrilling aesthetic anthem to the complexity of race--a full embrace of its pleasure and horror, in equal parts.

Is it possible, even for a fleeting moment, to call to the dead and free them from their death? Grossman's answer to such questions is a hymn to these characters, who ultimately find solace and hope in their communal act of breaching death's hermetic separateness.

Excerpt
""The soul, little else, is worth study,"" is a favorite quotation among Browning readers, taken from his introductory note to ""Sordello."" In whatsoever condition the soul is, it is still his immortal theme. ""The Soul's Tragedy,"" to his mind, occurs, when all primal elements are filmed over by conventionalities, or by human wisdom, or by utilitarian considerations, until they have oozed away and no real personality is left. The fixedness of the soulless soul is what the author of ""Christmas Eve"" considers the most fearful and solemn death.
This poem is a narrative, and the narrator finds himself dodging a storm. He seeks to enter a little dissenting chapel, situated
Where the town's bad blood once slept corruptly.
He snuggles himself up as closely as he can in the little four-by-six porch which serves as a doorway. He becomes interested in the different specimens of human nature that hurriedly and drippingly crowd past him to enter the door, the inner door, whose latch ""grew more obstinate the more they fumbled.""",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19061106-christmas-eve,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19061106-christmas-eve,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,7,13635909,Christmas Eve,Christmas Eve

Here Pavlova returns to her childhood to peruse its key ingredients (-a glass jar, a rag, a sponge . . . Mom's listening to the Beatles, / Dad, to Radio Liberty-), confronts adulthood (-And, please, no forbidden fruits!-), balances her loves and losses (-Without you, my unquenchable . . . woes are bearable, / joys are not-).

34456055,1,US,true,3.91,"'The most popular English poet since Larkin.' Sunday Times
After more than a decade and following his celebrated adventures in drama, translation, travel writing and prose poetry, Simon Armitage's eleventh collection of poems heralds a return to his trademark contemporary lyricism. The pieces in this multi-textured and moving volume are set against a backdrop of economic recession and social division, where mass media, the mass market and globalisation have made alienation a commonplace experience and where the solitary imagination drifts and conjures.
The Unaccompanied documents a world on the brink, a world of unreliable seasons and unstable coordinates, where Odysseus stalks the aisles of cut-price supermarkets in search of direction, where the star of Bethlehem rises over industrial Yorkshire, and where alarm bells for ailing communities go unheeded or unheard. Looking for certainty the mind gravitates to recollections of upbringing and family, only to encounter more unrecoverable worlds, shaped as ever through Armitage's gifts for clarity and detail as well as his characteristic dead-pan wit. Insightful, relevant and empathetic, these poems confirm The Unaccompanied as a bold new statement of intent by one of our most respected and recognised living poets.

Petrarch was born in Tuscany and grew up in the south of France. He lived his life in the service of the church, traveled widely, and during his lifetime was a revered, model man of letters.
Petrarch's greatest gift to posterity was his Rime in vita e morta di Madonna Laura, the cycle of poems popularly known as his songbook. By turns full of wit, languor, and fawning, endlessly inventive, in a tightly composed yet ornate form they record their speaker's unrequited obsession with the woman named Laura. In the centuries after it was designed, the ""Petrarchan sonnet,"" as it would be known, inspired the greatest love poets of the English language--from the times of Spenser and Shakespeare to our own.
David Young's fresh, idiomatic version of Petrarch's poetry is the most readable and approachable that we have. In his skillful hands, Petrarch almost sounds like a poet out of our own tradition bringing the wheel of influence full circle.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22462438-the-poetry-of-petrarch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22462438-the-poetry-of-petrarch,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,1,222162,The Poetry of Petrarch,The Poetry of Petrarch

He was educated at the Boston Latin School and at Harvard College, from which he graduated at eighteen. On leaving college he taught school for some time, and in 1825 returned to Cambridge to study divinity. The next year he began to preach; and in 1829 he married Ellen Tucker, and was chosen colleague to the Rev, Henry Ware, minister of the historic church in Hanover Street, Boston. So far things seemed to he going well with him; but in 1831 his wife died, and in the next year scruples about administering the Lord's Supper led him to give up his church. In sadness and poor health he set out in December on his first visit to Europe, passing through Italy, Switzerland, and France to Britain, and visiting Landor, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and, most important of all, Carlyle, with whom he laid the foundation of a life-long friendship. On his return to America he took up lecturing, and he continued for nearly forty years to use this form of expression for his ideas on religion, politics, literature, and philosophy. In 1833 he bought a house in Concord, and took there his second wife, Lidian Jackson, The history of the rest of his life is uneventful, as far as external incident is concerned. He traveled frequently giving lectures; took part in founding in 1840 the ""Dial,"" and in 1837 the ''Atlantic Monthly,"" to both of which he contributed freely, and the former of which he edited for a short time; introduced the writings of Carlyle to America, and published a succession of volumes of essays, addresses, and poems.

A year before its publication Thomas died from swelling of the brain triggered by excessive drinking. (A piece of New Directions history: it was our founder James Laughlin who identified Thomas' body at the morgue of St. Vincent's Hospital.)
Since its initial publication in 1953, this book has become the definitive edition of the poet's work. Thomas wrote ""Prologue"" addressed to ""my readers, the strangers"" -- an introduction in verse that was the last poem he would ever write. Also included are classics such as ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion,"" ""Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night,"" and ""Fern Hill"" that have influenced generations of artists from Bob Dylan (who changed his last name from Zimmerman in honor of the poet), to John Lennon (The Beatles included Thomas' portrait on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band); this collection even appears in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Roadwhen it is retrieved from the rubble of a bookshelf.

In Paul Hostovsky's eighth book of poetry, The Bad Guys, there are poems about suicide bombers and high school bullies, capricious exes and ecstatic bums, fastidious drug-dealers and contemplative alcoholics, evil stenches and spiritual moms; poems about the Republicans, the mega-hospitals, the brusque and bearded anesthesiologists, and the lady who gave out pencils on Halloween.

Fusing the personal and the political in high-voltage verse, Amiri Baraka--""whose long illumination of the black experience in America was called incandescent in some quarters and incendiary in others"" (New York Times)--was one of the preeminent literary innovators of the past century. Selected by Paul Vangelisti, this volume comprises the fullest spectrum of Baraka's rousing, revolutionary poems, from his first collection to previously unpublished pieces composed during his final years.
Throughout Baraka's career as a prolific writer (also published as LeRoi Jones), he was vehemently outspoken against oppression of African American citizens, and he radically altered the discourse surrounding racial inequality. The environments and social values that inspired his poetics changed during the course of his life, a trajectory that can be traced in this retrospective spanning more than five decades of profoundly evolving subjects and techniques. Praised for its lyricism and introspection, his early poetry emerged from the Beat generation, while his later writing is marked by intensely rebellious fervor and subversive ideology. All along, his primary focus was on how to live and love in the present moment despite the enduring difficulties of human history.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25062475-s-o-s,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25062475-s-o-s,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,8,42018302,S O S: Poems 1961-2013,S O S: Poems 1961-2013

28514407,1,US,true,3.8,"Tracey Herd's new collection, Not in This World, was originally inspired by the late actress Elizabeth Hartman's lifelong struggle with mental illness. The book examines the eternal bonds of love and friendship and the joys and grief which accompany these relationships using personal experience and the mediums of film, music and - of course - horse racing.
Not in This Worldis Tracey Herd's third collection from Bloodaxe. Her debut, No Hiding Place(1996) was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection, and her second collection, Dead Redhead(2001), was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.
'This is a writer who takes herself, and us, into difficult territory, not out of any patronising desire to ""shock"" but out of her own inner necessity. Dead Redheadis a hall of fame, where the famous are dead, iconic women: Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Onassis, the murdered daughters of the Tzar. Into these women, who have something of the traditional ballad heroine about them, Herd sinks her own sensibility to animate this world of vulnerable beauty, and victimhood. The poems are energetic discussions of the effect of power and betrayal, and Herd explores the reasons these screen goddesses, girl detectives, princesses seem to matter, how they are at once remote and very near at hand, their lives provide ways for us to discuss our own' - Kathleen Jamie, PBS Bulletin.
'She is already in possession of a distinctive vocal tone and it displays a formidable command of technique and the workings of a powerful imagination... Although the subject-matter of many, indeed of most, of the poems is pretty bleak, the poems themselves are anything but depressing, satisfying eye and ear with their coruscating surfaces and varied music, and the mind with their sharpness of perception and wit' - Vernon Scannell, Sunday Telegraph.
'Tracey Herd is a one-off. Though influenced by the emergence of a vibrant and independent new Scottish poetry, she reaches out across cultures and national poetics, projecting a noirish psycho-linguistic drama onto the screen of predictability. She is risky and challenging, and her poems carry a sting in the tail. The twists and turns of her voice, sublimated by others', test the fragility of her readers' perceptions. Persona falls victim to the power of language, the total control of line and rhythm. She is terrifyingly brilliant' - John Kinsella, Verse
'Many of the characters are vulnerable selves with whom she connects empathetically and sometimes painfully. The poems are multi-layered, a series of tensions exist within them, sometimes explicit, but usually inferred' - Steve Davies, Poetry Quarterly Review.

19215311,1,US,true,4.39,"an excerpt from the Introduction: St. John of the Cross took up his pen in order to supplement the writings of St. Teresa; on several subjects, for example, he abstained from writing at length because she had already treated of them. Much of the work of the two Saints, however, of necessity covers the same ground, and thus the great mystical school of the Spanish Carmelites is reinforced at its very beginnings in a way which must be unique in the history of mysticism. The writings of St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross, though of equal value and identical aim, are in many respects very different in their nature; together they cover almost the entire ground of orthodox mysticism, both speculative and experimental. The Carmelite mystics who came after them were able to build upon a broad and sure foundation. The writings of St. John of the Cross soon became known outside the narrow circle of his sons and daughters in religion. In a few years they had gone all over Spain and reached Portugal, France and Italy. They were read by persons of every social class, from the Empress Maria of Austria, sister of Philip II, to the most unlettered nuns of St. Teresa's most remote foundations. One of the witnesses at the process for the beatification declared that he knew of no works of which there existed so many copies, with the exception of the Bible. We may fairly suppose (and the supposition is confirmed by the nature of the extant manuscripts) that the majority of the early copies were made by friars and nuns of the Discalced Reform. Most Discalced houses must have had copies and others were probably in the possession of members of other Orders. We gather, too, from various sources, that even lay persons managed to make or obtain copies of the manuscripts. How many of these copies, it will be asked, were made directly from the autographs? So vague is the available evidence on this question that it is difficult to attempt any calculation of even approximate reliability. All we can say is that the copies made by, or for, the Discalced friars and nuns themselves are the earliest and most trustworthy, while those intended for the laity were frequently made at third or fourth hand. The Saint himself seems to have written out only one manuscript of each treatise and none of these has come down to us. Some think that he destroyed the manuscripts copied with his own hand, fearing that they might come to be venerated for other reasons than that of the value of their teaching. He was, of course, perfectly capable of such an act of abnegation; once, as we know, in accordance with his own principles, he burned some letters of St. Teresa, which he had carried with him for years, for no other reason than that he realized that he was becoming attached to them.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19215311-ascent-of-mount-carmel,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19215311-ascent-of-mount-carmel,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,2,763750,Ascent of Mount Carmel,Ascent of Mount Carmel

One of the forefront leaders of the Acmeism movement, which focused on rigorous form and directness of words, she was a master of conveying raw emotion in her portrayals of everyday situations. Her works range from short lyric love poetry to longer, more complex cycles, such as Requiem, a tragic depiction of the Stalinist terror. During the time of heavy censorship and persecution, her poetry gave voice to the Russian people. To this day, she remains one of Russia's most beloved poets and has left a lasting impression on generations of poets that came after her.
Rosary, published in 1914, is Akhmatova's second book, and one of her most popular collections.

28426078,1,US,true,4.44,"Compendio que reune toda a composicao poetica ortonima de Pessoa (mais de 400 poemas). Por composicao poetica ortonima entende-se os poemas que foram assinados pelo seu proprio nome em vez de um dos seus muitos heteronimos.
O poeta e um fingidor.
Finge tao completamente
Que chega a fingir que e dor
A dor que deveras sente.
Fernando Pessoa e considerado um dos maiores poetas da Lingua Portuguesa, e da Literatura Universal, muitas vezes comparado com Luis de Camoes. O critico literario Harold Bloom considerou a sua obra um ""legado da lingua portuguesa ao mundo"".
Considera-se que a grande criacao estetica de Pessoa foi a invencao heteronimica que atravessa toda a sua obra. Os seus heteronimos, diferentemente dos pseudonimos, sao personalidades poeticas completas: identidades que, em principio nao existentes, tornam-se verdadeiras atraves da sua manifestacao artistica propria e diversa do autor original.
A obra ortonima de Pessoa passou por diferentes fases, mas envolve basicamente a procura de um certo patriotismo perdido, atraves de uma atitude sebastianista reinventada. O ortonimo foi profundamente influenciado, em varios momentos, por doutrinas religiosas (como a teosofia) e sociedades secretas (como a Maconaria). A poesia resultante tem um certo ar mitico, heroico (quase epico, mas nao na acecao original do termo) e por vezes tragico.Diversos estudos de Pessoa procuraram enumerar os seus heteronimos, semi-heteronimos, personagens ficticias e poetas mediunicos e as conclusoes divergem. A mais recente apresenta uma lista com 127 nomes. Entre os inumeros heteronimos, o proprio Fernando Pessoa, figura ortonima, tornou-se apenas mais um heteronimo entre os outros e todas as composicoes poeticas que foram assinadas com o seu proprio nome diferenciam-se por um estilo proprio.
O ortonimo e considerado, so por si, como simbolista e modernista pela evanescencia, indefinicao e insatisfacao, bem como pela inovacao praticada atraves de diversos estilos de formulacao do discurso poetico (sensacionalismo, paulismo, interseccionismo, etc.)",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28426078-antologia-po-tica,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28426078-antologia-po-tica,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451685349m/28426078.jpg,3,61317,Antologia Poética: uma compilação dos poemas do maior poeta da língua portuguesa do século XX,Antologia Poética: uma compilação dos poemas do maior poeta da língua portuguesa do século XX

23974948,3,US,true,4.5,"David Hamilton brings together two poems and a dramatic monologue in King Alfred's Jewel: Poetry of the Imagination and Imaginative Photography. This contemporary, original poetry is inspired by the stories behind outlaw legends, and also takes the reader on a number of spiritual journies.
Hamilton's first poem, The Journey, remains almost as it was first written. In striving to keep his writing spontaneous, he chose not to over-develop the form of his writing.
King Alfred's Jewel is the title poem and draws its inspiration from The Dark Night of the Soul by Roman Catholic mystic Saint John of the Cross. Using a journey to find the king's jewel as a guiding theme, the poem is a metaphor for the depression many people feel today and mistakenly try to substitute with unhealthy pasttimes.
The dramatic monologue, Wolfshead, which comes at the end of the book, is an imaginative tale of outlaw legends. A 'wolfshead' was a resort of outlaws who formed a community, and this particular story is set in Sherwood Forest with Robin Hood presiding. Using two chorus figures to link proceedings and set the scene, this wolfshead is a ghostly gathering who return to tell their legendary stories...

While its narrator sets out to construct a sort of 'pillow book' about her lifelong obsession with the colour blue, she ends up facing down both the painful end of an affair and the grievous injury of a dear friend. The combination produces a raw, cerebral work devoted to the inextricability of pleasure and pain, and to the question of what role, if any, aesthetic beauty can play in times of great heartache or grief.
Much like Roland Barthes's A Lover's Discourse, Bluetshas passed between lovers in the ecstasy of new love, and been pressed into the hands of the heartbroken.

35161563,2,US,true,4.61,"An undeniable aura surrounds the name of Georg Trakl, a poet of intense inner vision and originality whose work stands alongside that of Yeats, Valery, and T. S. Eliot. Besides Rilke, his more famous admirers include Karl Kraus and Martin Heidegger. The distinctive tone of Trakl's work-especially admired by his patron Ludwig Wittgenstein-is autumnal and melancholy. Trakl was writing at a time of spiritual and social disintegration on the eve of the First World War, when personal values and perceptions tended to be subsumed in a more generalized anguish and exaltation. Neo-romantic, early modernist, his rich, vitally sensuous poetry can be seen to mark the transition from impressionism to expressionism, but at the same time transcends such categories. Trakl's poetry has previously only been available in English in short selections or in anthologies.

All are welcome at this twilit, visionary carnival: the man whose wife drapes a border-curtain across the middle of the marital home; the black bear with a dark secret; the woman who oversees giant snowballs in the freezer. ""My girlfriend won me in a sealed auction but wouldn't / tell me how much she bid,"" begins one speaker; ""I hadn't meant to go grave robbing with Richard Dawkins / but he can be very persuasive,"" another tells us. The storyteller behind this human tapestry has about him a sly undercover idealism: he shares with many of his characters a stargazing capacity for belief, or for being, at the very least, entirely ""genuine in his disbelief."" In these startling poems, with their unique cartoon-strip energy and air of misrule, Armitage creates world after world, peculiar and always particular, where the only certainty is the unexpected.

Internationally best-selling poet Christian Bok has spent more than ten years writing what promises to be the first example of ""living poetry."" After successfully demonstrating his concept in a colony of E. coli, Bok is on the verge of enciphering a beautiful, anomalous poem into the genome of an unkillable bacterium (Deinococcus radiodurans), which can, in turn, ""read"" his text, responding to it by manufacturing a viable, benign protein, whose sequence of amino acids enciphers yet another poem. The engineered organism might conceivably serve as a post-apocalyptic archive, capable of outlasting our civilization.
Book I of The Xenotext constitutes a kind of ""demonic grimoire,"" providing a scientific framework for the project with a series of poems, texts, and illustrations. A Virgilian welcome to the Inferno, Book I is the ""orphic"" volume in a diptych, addressing the pastoral heritage of poets, who have sought to supplant nature in both beauty and terror. The book sets the conceptual groundwork for the second volume, which will document the experiment itself. The Xenotext is experimental poetry in the truest sense of the term.

David Rakoff, who died in 2012 at the age of 47, built a deserved reputation as one of the finest and funniest essayists of our time. This intricately woven novel, written with humour, sympathy and tenderness, proves him the master of an altogether different art form.

35585628,1,US,true,4.26,"I fiori del male viene considerata una delle opere poetiche piu influenti, celebri e innovative non solo dell'Ottocento francesema di tutti i tempi. Il lirismo aulico, le atmosfere surreali di un modernismo ancora reduce della poetica romantica, lo sfondo vagamente sinistro, tradusse Baudelaire nello stereotipo del ""poeta maledetto"": chiuso in se stesso, a venerare i piaceri della carne e tradurre la propria visione del mondo in una comprensione d'infinita sofferenza e bassezza. L'intenso misticismo del linguaggio e un rigore formale freddo si trovano ad affrontare temi metafisici, teologici ed esotici.
Charles Pierre Baudelaire (1821-1867) e stato un poeta, scrittore, critico letterario, critico d'arte, giornalista, filosofo, aforista, saggista e traduttore francese.
E considerato uno dei piu importanti poeti del XIX secolo, esponente chiave del simbolismo, affiliato del parnassianesimo e grande innovatore del genere lirico, nonche anticipatore del decadentismo. I fiori del male, la sua opera maggiore, e considerata uno dei classici della letteratura francese e mondiale.
Il pensiero e la vita di Baudelaire hanno influenzato molti autori successivi (primi fra tutti i ""poeti maledetti"" come Verlaine, Mallarme e Rimbaud, ma anche gli scapigliati italiani come Emilio Praga, o Marcel Proust, Edmund Wilson, Dino Campana, nonche, in particolar modo, Paul Valery), appartenenti anche a correnti letterarie e vissuti in periodi storici differenti, ed e considerato ancor oggi non solo come uno dei precursori della letteratura decadente, ma anche di quella poetica e di quella filosofia nei confronti della societa, dell'arte, dell'essenza dei rapporti tra esseri umani, dell'emotivita, dell'amore e della vita che lui stesso aveva definito come ""modernismo"".",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35585628-i-fiori-del-male,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35585628-i-fiori-del-male,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,5,2089235,I fiori del male,I fiori del male

All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.Long before The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Harry Potter, the ancient Greek poet Homerestablished the standard for tales of epic quests and heroic journeys with The Odyssey. Crowded with characters, both human and non-human, and bursting with action, The Odysseydetails the adventures of Odysseus, king of Ithaca and hero of the Trojan War, as he struggles to return to his home and his waiting, ever-faithful wife, Penelope.Along the way he encounters the seductive Circe, who changes men into swine; the gorgeous water-nymph, Calypso, who keeps him a prisoner of love for seven years; the terrible, one-eyed, man-eating giant Cyclops; and a host of other ogres, wizards, sirens, and gods. But when he finally reaches Ithaca after ten years of travel, his trials have only begun. There he must battle the scheming noblemen who, thinking him dead, have demanded that Penelope choose one of them to be her new husbandand Ithaca s new king.
Often called the second work of Western literature (The Iliad, also by Homer, being the first), The Odysseyis not only a rousing adventure drama, but also a profound meditation on courage, loyalty, family, fate, and undying love. More than three thousand years old, it was the first story to delineate carefully and exhaustively a single character arc a narrative structure that serves as the foundation and heart of the modern novel. Robert Squillace s revision of George Herbert Palmer s classic prose translation captures the drama and vitality of adventure, while remaining true to the original Homeric language.
Robert Squillaceteaches in the Cultural Foundations division of New York University s General Studies Program. He has published numerous essays on literature and the book Modernism, Modernity and Arnold Bennett.

Michael Ondaatje has called Sharon Olds's poetry ""pure fire in the hands"" and cheered the ""roughness and humor and brag and tenderness and completion in her work as she carries the reader through rooms of passion and loss."" This rich selection exhibits those qualities in poem after poem, reflecting, moreover, an exciting experimentation with rhythm and language and a movement toward an embrace beyond the personal. Subjects are revisited-the pain of childhood, adolescent sexual stirrings, the fulfillment of marriage, the wonder of children-but each recasting penetrates ever more deeply, enriched by new perceptions and conceits.

Imagine the shock, imagine the sadness when a daughter discovers her father's work, the poetry he had never shared with anyone during the last two decades of his life. Six years after that moment of discovery, which happened in her childhood home while mourning for his passing, Uvi Poznansky presents a tender tribute: a collection of poems and prose, half of which is written by her, and half--by her father, the author, poet and artist Zeev Kachel. She has been translating his poems for nearly a year, with careful attention to rhyme and rhythm, in an effort to remain faithful to the spirit of his words.
Zeev's writing is always autobiographical in nature; you can view it as an ongoing diary of his life. Uvi's writing is rarely so, especially when it comes to her prose. She is a storyteller who delights in conjuring up various figments of her imagination, and fleshing them out on paper. She sees herself chasing her characters with a pen, in an attempt to see the world from their point of view, and to capture their voices. But in some of her poems, she offers you a rare glimpse into her most guarded, intensely private moments, yearning for Home.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18047013-home,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18047013-home,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457366365m/18047013.jpg,18,21732386,Home,Home

Each season is inspired by her experiences: grieving a lost baby, understanding depression, anger, betrayal, surviving rape and the acceptance that she cannot forgive. Balanced somehow within the darkness is the wonder in motherhood and empathetic relationships. As her seasons change, she continues trying to find the balance of existing between normalcy and madness.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30556174-tea-and-madness,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30556174-tea-and-madness,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1465865462m/30556174.jpg,10,45372595,Tea and Madness,Tea and Madness

Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.
But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers--especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami's determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.
So when she is invited to join her school's slam poetry club, she doesn't know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can't stop thinking about performing her poems.

Charles Bukowski was a man of intense emotions, someone an editor once called a ""passionate madman."" In On Love, we see Bukowski reckoning with the complications and exaltations of love, lust, and desire. Alternating between tough and gentle, sensitive and gritty, Bukowski lays bare the myriad facets of love--its selfishness and its narcissism, its randomness, its mystery and its misery, and, ultimately, its true joyfulness, endurance, and redemptive power.
Bukowski is brilliant on love--often amusing, sometimes playful, and fleetingly sweet. On Loveoffers deep insight into Bukowski the man and the artist; whether writing about his daughter, his lover, his friends, or his work, he is piercingly honest and poignantly reflective, using love as a prism to see the world in all its beauty and cruelty, and his own fragile place in it. ""My love is a hummingbird sitting that quiet moment on the bough,"" he writes, ""as the same cat crouches.""

If I accomplish this then my job is done and I move onto my next drawing of words. Each word I use must represent the what is, the how is and the objective of. To be the poet, one must be the poem to be able to connect with their readers, if one cannot be the poet nor the poem, then it's not poetry.

When I don't feel this explosion, then it must not be, at least not poetry.

Per scoprirlo, basta leggere i suoi versi: chi lo ha fatto giura di non essere piu riuscito a smettere. Molti si sono emozionati, tutti confessano di aver riso a crepapelle, c'e chi alla fine si e pure innamorato. In questa raccolta ci sono poesie per tutte le occasioni: quelle da leggere da soli la sera, accoccolati sotto il piumone, e quelle da declamare a voce alta; quelle per fare colpo sulla persona che ti piace; quelle per chi sogna labbra lontane. Ci sono poesie per chi e stato mollato e per chi, piu modestamente, aspetta soltanto di far bollire le carote. Ci sono fidanzate vecchie e nuove, sbronze sotto la luna, invasioni di zombie. Ma anche tanta vita quotidiana: l'ispirazione che non arriva, i black-out estivi e un mondo di rondini, muratori e passanti ubriachi che si fa beffe del poeta al lavoro. Di nazisti, invece, non ce n'e nemmeno uno: il tasso di baci presente in queste pagine non l'avrebbe consentito. Catalano e il poeta che ha infranto le gabbie in cui si vorrebbero relegati i poeti per prendersi uno spazio di cui si ignorava l'esistenza, sorprendendo critica e pubblico con i suoi reading in giro per l'Italia, e adesso ci racconta i ""piccoli fatti felici"" della vita e dell'amore come solo lui sa fare.

I, too, dislike it and have largely organized my life around it and do not experience that as a contradiction because poetry and the hatred of poetry are inextricable in ways it is my purpose to explore.""
In this inventive and lucid essay, Lerner takes the hatred of poetry as the starting point of his defense of the art. He examines poetry's greatest haters (beginning with Plato's famous claim that an ideal city had no place for poets, who would only corrupt and mislead the young) and both its greatest and worst practitioners, providing inspired close readings of Keats, Dickinson, McGonagall, Whitman, and others. Throughout, he attempts to explain the noble failure at the heart of every truly great and truly horrible poem: the impulse to launch the experience of an individual into a timeless communal existence.

Kalevalan sisaltamat runot eivat ole suoraan runonlaulajien laulamassa muodossa, vaan niita on muokattu, niiden kieliasua on yhtenaistetty ja korjailtu ja joitakin osia runoista on siirretty toiseen paikkaan ja eri asiayhteyteen kuin alun perin muistiin merkityissa runoissa.

25142854,10,US,true,3.88,"A raw and tenderly funny look at the human-cat relationship, from one of our most treasured and transgressive writers
""The cat is the beautiful devil.""
Felines touched a vulnerable spot in Charles Bukowski's crusty soul. For the writer, there was something majestic and elemental about these inscrutable creatures he admired, sentient beings whose searing gaze could penetrate deep into our being. Bukowski considered cats to be unique forces of nature, elusive emissaries of beauty and love.
On Cats offers Bukowski's musings on these beloved animals and their toughness and resiliency. He honors them as fighters, hunters, survivors who command awe and respect as they grip tightly onto the world around them: ""A cat is only ITSELF, representative of the strong forces of life that won't let go.""
Funny, moving, tough, and caring, Bukowski's On Cats brings together the acclaimed writer's reflections on these animals he so admired. Bukowski's cats are fierce and demanding--he captures them stalking their prey; crawling across his typewritten pages; waking him up with claws across the face. But they are also affectionate and giving, sources of inspiration and gentle, insistent care.
Poignant yet free of treacle, On Cats is an illuminating portrait of this one-of-a-kind artist and his unique view of the world, witnessed through his relationship with the animals he considered his most profound teachers.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25142854-on-cats,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25142854-on-cats,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426363667m/25142854.jpg,92,44216022,On Cats,On Cats

""Instant coffee and a tip from the sound-guy. I'm learning sounds, laying wide awake on different sofas every night. I know the difference between a well built wall and broken strength. I'm learning mindfulness, reading about gurus and poets every day on different trains to nowhere. I don't know what I'm learning but I hope I will understand one day. I'm selling my heart with each album and a silent prayer that they'll be gentle with it, gentle with me. And then the concerned looks they throw when I point at my worn out bag and broken guitar case as the answer to where I live. Sure I could spend a year or two selling my days and time for money, and I could buy all these things people want to have without never really needing it. It's just that when I'm on that stage every night, it all just seems so stupid. My guitar, my voice, my words, my story. That's all I want, that's what makes my heart beat. What am I supposed to do with belongings and material stuff when all I want is this. The open road and a new beginning every day.
I don't have a lot and I gave away the things you're supposed to have to be able to live. I don't own any keys and I threw my phone in the river.

""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" is a poem by English author Robert Browning, written in 1855 and first published that same year in the collection entitled Men and Women. The title, which forms the last words of the poem, is a line from William Shakespeare's play King Lear. In the play, Gloucester's son, Edgar, lends credence to his disguise as Tom o' Bedlam by talking nonsense, of which this is a part:
'Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
His word was still 'Fie, foh, and fum
I smell the blood of a British man.'
King Lear, Act 3, scene 4
Also, this poem stands at the foundation of Stephen King's Dark Towerseries.

Writing is a great love of mine. It is the way I truly express myself. It is a gateway to my id. I am most myself when I write. The poems date back from my teens to the Present Day. It covers my life from adolescence to adulthood. It tells of my dark moments, times that shone and both times I was in love. The poetry featured various in theme and tone - from joy, sorrow, dark and light. It covers fantasy and non fiction to Autobiographical. Some are indeed about me while others are very much outside myself yet express a facet of my nature.

I've dropped my phone on my face many times. I think other people must too, but I rarely hear about this.

The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art & morality, knowledge & truth, the intellectual conscience & the origin of logic.

In this incandescent, profound, and accessible collection, beloved and award-winning poet, novelist, and short-story writer Ron Rash vividly channels the rhythms of life in Appalachia, deftly capturing the panoply of individuals who are its heart and soul--men and women inured to misfortune and hard times yet defined by tremendous fortitude, resilience, and a fierce sense of community.
In precise, supple language that swerves from the stark to the luminous, Rash richly describes the splendor of the natural landscape and poignantly renders the lives of those dependent on its bounty--in cotton mills and tobacco fields, farmlands and forests. The haunting memories and shared histories of these people--their rituals and traditions--animate this land, and are celebrated in Rash's crystalline, intensely imagined verse.

""Anne Carson is, for me, the most exciting poet writing in English today.""--Michael Ondaatje
""This book is amazing--I haven't discovered any writing in years so marvelously disturbing."" --Alice Munro
The award-winning poet Anne Carson reinvents a genre in Autobiography of Red, a stunning work that is both a novel and a poem, both an unconventional re-creation of an ancient Greek myth and a wholly original coming-of-age story set in the present.
Geryon, a young boy who is also a winged red monster, reveals the volcanic terrain of his fragile, tormented soul in an autobiography he begins at the age of five. As he grows older, Geryon escapes his abusive brother and affectionate but ineffectual mother, finding solace behind the lens of his camera and in the arms of a young man named Herakles, a cavalier drifter who leaves him at the peak of infatuation. When Herakles reappears years later, Geryon confronts again the pain of his desire and embarks on a journey that will unleash his creative imagination to its fullest extent. By turns whimsical and haunting, erudite and accessible, richly layered and deceptively simple, Autobiography of Red is a profoundly moving portrait of an artist coming to terms with the fantastic accident of who he is.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. The epic song of Ilion (an old name for Troy), The"" ""Iliadrecreates a few dramatic weeks near the end of the fabled Trojan War, ending with the funeral of Hector, defender of the doomed city. Through its majestic verses stride the fabled heroes Priam, Hector, Paris, and Aeneas for Troy; Achilles, Ajax, Menelaus, Agamemnon, Patroclus, and Odysseus for the Greeks; and the beautiful Helen, over whom the longstanding war has been waged. Never far from the center of the story are the quarreling gods: Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite.
The Iliadis the oldest Greek poem and perhaps the best-known epic in Western literature, and has inspired countless works of art throughout its long history. An assemblage of stories and legends shaped into a compelling single narrative, ""The Iliad"" was probably recited orally by bards for generations before being written down in the eighth century B.C. A beloved fixture of early Greek culture, the poem found eager new audiences when it was translated into many languages during the Renaissance. Its themes of honor, power, status, heroism, and the whims of the gods have ensured its enduring popularity and immeasurable cultural influence.
Bruce M. King studied at the University of Chicago, and has taught classics and humanities at Columbia University, Reed College, and the University of Chicago.

19184751,2,US,true,4.54,"A biography of poet Basil Bunting.
Basil Bunting, Britain's greatest modernist poet, led an extraordinary life. He was born in 1900 in a small mining village in Tyneside, where he received a largely Quaker education and, at the age of thirteen, met the love of his life. His young life was hindered after he left school and went straight to prison as a conscientious objector. In the early twenties he worked in Paris as, variously, an artist's model and road mender, before being rescued from another strech in prison by Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford. Later the young poet found himself with Pound and W. B. Yeats in Rapallo where he worked on sand boats and wrote the poems that formed the backbone of Pound's influential Active Anthology. Bunting continued to move from place to place for the rest of his life. He and his young family fled their Canary Island home at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and the breakdown of his marriage saw him take residence on a boat off the south coast of England. During the Second World War he took advantage of his knowledge of classical Persian to work as a translator in Iraq. He later became a spy in the region, culminating in promotion to Vice Consul in Isfahan. His time as The Times Middle East correspondent was cut short when he was thrown out of Iran by Mossadeq in 1953. Briggflatts caught the literary world's attention, but fame brought him no relief from grinding poverty and he died at the age of 85, impoverished but with a lasting poetic legacy. This book tells a captivating tale of action, adventure and lasting friendships. We meet some of the finest writers of the last century, including Yeats, Pound, T. S.

Though officially unsolved, Jane's murder was apparently the third in a series of seven brutal rape-murders near the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. Nelson was born a few years after Jane's death, and the narrative is suffused with the long shadow her aunt's murder cast over both the family and her psyche. Through a collage of poetry, prose, dream accounts, and documentary sources -- including fragments from Jane's own diaries -- the book explores the nature of this haunting incident and raises deeper questions about girlhood, empathy, identification, and the essentially unknowable aspects of another's life and death. Part elegy, part memoir, part detective story, part meditation on violence, and part conversation between the living and the dead, Jane'spowerful and disturbing subject matter, combined with its innovations in genre, expands the notion of what poetry can do, what kinds of stories it can tell, and how it can tell them.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10201737-jane,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10201737-jane,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386587218m/10201737.jpg,2,97818,Jane: A Murder,Jane: A Murder

Krishna knows better: ""Your very nature will drive you to fight. Your only choice is what to fight against."" His advice gives an inspiring model of the man or woman of action -- the person who aims at goodness in a world of conflict and change. * In this translation, the Gita stands out as a book of choices--direct, practical, universal. The introduction sketches the background of the poem and gives clear, contemporary explanations of the basic ideas of Indian philosophy, karma, reincarnation, yoga, freedom.

Excerpt:
The ""Bhagavad Gita"" sometimes called ""The Lord's Lay,"" or the ""Message of the Master,"" is an episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in the Sixth (or ""Bhishma"") Parva. It enjoys the highest esteem among the Hindu people, and is constantly quoted there as a great authority regarding doctrine. Its philosophy embodies the prevailing Hindu beliefs, as expounded by the Brahmans, and in its teachings it subtly blends into a harmonious whole the varying points of doctrine of Patanjali, Kapila and of the Vedas. It is supposed to have been written by Vyasa whose personality is veiled in doubt for of the time of his existence in the world no record seems to have been kept.
To the reader who finds in this marvelous dialogue merely the record of a literal conversation dressed up in fancy by the Oriental imagination, the real beauty and purpose of the teaching is lost.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8176563-the-bhagavad-gita,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8176563-the-bhagavad-gita,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,95,1492580,The Bhagavad Gita,The Bhagavad Gita

24813347,26,US,true,4.95,"Tukaram was a seventeenth century Indian poet who challenged the norms of the day, whether literary, social or religious in his poems that not only energized a decaying society but also influenced the centuries to come. Tukaram's poetry hold its rejuvenating powers even in the turbulent times of our own twenty-first century. One Hundred Poems of Tukaram is a translation of selected poems of this visionary poet who makes his reader see every aspect of life in a new light, enabling them to rethink the whole world in more positive terms.
Tukaram's reputation as one of the greatest poets born in India resides on his four thousand or so extant poems which he composed in Marathi, his mother tongue. Unlike most of the poets of the seventeenth century, Tukaram did not write in highly Sanskitised Marathi, instead he chose the colloquial language spoken by the common-most people of his times. This has given a distinct vigour to his compositions which appeal straight to the heart of his readers. By temperament, Tukaram is as candid and as forthright as imaginable and does not hesitate to write about anything under the sun nor does he consider anything too holy to be left untouched. This makes his poems penetratingly consistent in taking aim at the very core of the questions grappling human existence. Though he wrote almost four hundred years ago, in a very different social milieu than today's globalised and digitized world, somehow he seems to be dealing with and overcoming exactly the same dilemmas faced by the human populace in the twenty first century the world over. This continuum of human condition is what drew me more and more to the poems of Tukaram.
Despite the fact that Tukaram was a widely revered saint, arguably the greatest of his times, his poetry is not conventionally devotional. Of course, the predominant theme in his poems is that of spirituality. Yet, even at a cursory reading, one understands Tukaram's poems to be markedly different from other devotional/spiritual poems. The reason is Tukaram's honesty when it comes to self-expression. He does not only harp upon his 'oneness' with the Lord or the bliss attained thereof or the knowledge obtained thereby, but he goes on to expressing in his poems his entire spiritual and worldly journey with all its dramatic ups and downs - with 'downs' seemingly outnumbering 'ups'. Resultantly, in his poems we do not come across some spiritually enlightened 'being' talking down to us from his high pedestal but someone from amongst us who has started from the bottom and knows exactly how steep the climb is. Therefore, while reading Tukaram, one cannot help but feel that it is not just the poet's journey that is unfolding; it is the journey of each one of us. As if Tukaram holds our hand and takes us on that path leading to the ultimate goal of human life. Thus Tukaram's poetry does not remain the expression of one individual but of the entire humanity existent in all places at all times!
While reading Tukaram, one gets an eerie feeling that Tukaram is a contemporary poet, that the content of his poems is of the present times, that he writes for the current generations. Thus we come across in his poems all that angst that we today experience on seeing innocent people suffering at the hands of the terrorists, when he exclaims:
""Eyes cannot bear to see
Such is the devastation
Pains of others grieve
My heart""
It hardly matters that Tukaram is writing in this poem about the horrific droughts of his times that wiped out an entire generation; this becomes an expression of my heart writhing in pain seeing the images of the thousands of Nigerians killed in the Boko Haram attack. It hardly matters that Tukaram is talking about a nature-inflicted calamity, while our miseries today are self-inflicted. Tukaram's words catch hold of our aching nerve like no contemporary of ours can.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24813347-one-hundred-poems-of-tukaram,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24813347-one-hundred-poems-of-tukaram,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422953549m/24813347.jpg,36,44453842,One Hundred Poems of Tukaram,One Hundred Poems of Tukaram

But throughout his success, he carried with him the pain of being abandoned by his father and growing up in the tough neighborhoods of Chicago's South Side.
So he sat down with pen and paper and processed his pain the only way he knew how--through poetry. The resulting poem, Dear Father, became his vehicle of forgiveness and healing. It is a pivotal poem that has touched and inspired the lives of millions.

16112078,6,US,true,3.88,"Caduto fuori dal tempoe un punto d'arrivo nella carriera letteraria di uno dei massimi scrittori contemporanei, uno di quei libri che portano la nostra consapevolezza e la nostra capacita di sentire a un limite oltre il quale non e possibile andare.
Tutto comincia con un'immagine, un gesto, un movimento di misteriosa, evocativa potenza: un uomo si alza all'improvviso da tavola, prende commiato dalla moglie ed esce per andare ""laggiu"". Ha perso un figlio, anni prima, e ""laggiu"" e dove il mondo dei vivi confina con la terra dei morti.
Non sa dove sta andando, e soprattutto non sa cosa trovera. Lascia che siano le gambe a condurlo, per giorni e notti gira intorno alla sua citta e a poco a poco si unisce a lui una variegata serie di personaggi che vivono lo stesso dramma e lo stesso dolore: il Duca signore di quelle terre, una riparatrice di reti da pesca, una levatrice, un ciabattino, un anziano insegnante che risolve problemi di matematica sui muri delle case. E l'uomo a cui e stato affidato l'incarico di scrivere le cronache cittadine. Ciascuno ha la propria storia, chi ha perso il figlio per una grave malattia, chi in un incidente, chi in guerra. Insieme a loro idealmente, visto che non puo muoversi dalla sua stanza, c'e anche una strana figura di Centauro, con la parte inferiore del corpo che nel tempo si e trasformata in scrivania. E uno scrittore che da quindici anni vive circondato dagli oggetti del figlio che non c'e piu, e il cui unico desiderio da allora e catturare quella morte con le parole. ""Non riesco a capire qualcosa finche non la scrivo"" dice. E lui a ispirare e a inglobare la storia che stiamo leggendo.
La marcia di quei genitori prosegue in giri sempre piu ampi intorno alla citta, monologando o dialogando ognuno di essi parla di se, del desiderio di rivedere almeno una volta il proprio figlio, della vita che si e interrotta in quel tragico momento. E ognuno ha una sua voce, che Grossman in modo sublime trasforma nella voce della poesia, la lingua del dolore.
Arriveranno ""laggiu""? Si, ci arriveranno, fusi a quel punto in un coro di pura e profonda umanita.
E noi con loro, in pagine di sconvolgente intensita e verita. Per capire, insieme a Centauro, che il cammino di questi uomini e donne esiliati nella terra del dolore e stato una ""lotta contro la distruzione, la cancellazione, l'oblio"", il bisogno di dare un paesaggio a quella terra, la volonta di sottrarre la memoria alla tenebra per riconsegnarla alla vita.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16112078-caduto-fuori-dal-tempo,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16112078-caduto-fuori-dal-tempo,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1351353705m/16112078.jpg,22,21655329,Caduto fuori dal tempo,Caduto fuori dal tempo

Here, Divakaruni is particularly interested in how different art forms can influence and inspire each other. One section, entitled Indian Miniatures, is based on and named after a series of paintings by Francesco Clemente. Another, called Moving Pictures, is based on Indian films, including Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" and Satyajit Ray's ""Ghare Baire."" Photographs by Raghubir Singh inspired the section entitled Rajasthani. The trials and tribulations of growing up and immigration are also considered here and, as with all of Divakaruni's writing, these poems deal with the experience of women and their struggle to find identities for themselves.

Alberto Caeiro e considerado o mestre dos heteronimos de Fernando Pessoa, apesar de sua pouca instrucao. Poeta complexo e enigmatico, ligado a natureza, despreza e repreende qualquer tipo de pensamento filosofico, afirmando que pensar retira a visao, nao o permite ver o mundo tal qual ele lhe foi apresentado: simples e belo. Afirma que ao pensar, entra num mundo complexo e problematico, onde tudo e incerto e obscuro.

Mutability - a sense that all matter is unstable in the face of mortality - is at the heart of this new collection and each poem is involved in that drama: the held tension that is embodied life, and life's losing struggle with the gravity of nature.
Working as before with an ear to the oral tradition, these poems attend to the organic shapes and sounds and momentum of the language as it's spoken as well as how it's thought: fresh, fluid and propulsive, but also fragmentary, repetitive. These are poems that are written to be read aloud.

25022248,8,US,true,4.4,"An enchanting collection of the very best of Russian poetry, edited by acclaimed translator Robert Chandler together with poets Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, poetry's pre-eminence in Russia was unchallenged, with Pushkin and his contemporaries ushering in the 'Golden Age' of Russian literature. Prose briefly gained the high ground in the second half of the nineteenth century, but poetry again became dominant in the 'Silver Age' (the early twentieth century), when belief in reason and progress yielded once more to a more magical view of the world. During the Soviet era, poetry became a dangerous, subversive activity; nevertheless, poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova continued to defy the censors. This anthology traces Russian poetry from its Golden Age to the modern era, including work by several great poets - Georgy Ivanov and Varlam Shalamov among them - in captivating modern translations by Robert Chandler and others. The volume also includes a general introduction, chronology and individual introductions to each poet.

19521363,3,US,true,4.26,"Stephen Crane (1871-1900) was an American novelist, poet and journalist. He is best known for his novel Red Badge of Courage (1895). The novel introduced for most readers Crane's strikingly original prose, an intensely rendered mix of impressionism, naturalism and symbolism. He lived in New York City a bohemian life where he observed the poor in the Bowery slums as research for his first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), a milestone in uncompromising realism and in the early development of literary naturalism. He became shipwrecked in route to Cuba in early 1897, an experience which he later transformed into his short story masterpiece, The Open Boat (1898). Crane's poetry, which he called 'lines' rather than poems, was also strikingly new in its minimalist meter and rhyme. It employed symbolic imagery in order to communicate at times heavy-handed irony and paradox. Other works include Active Service (1899), The Monster (1899), The Blue Hotel (1899), Whilomville Stories (1900) and Wounds in the Rain (1900).",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19521363-the-black-riders-and-other-lines,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19521363-the-black-riders-and-other-lines,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,21,2139896,The Black Riders and Other Lines,The Black Riders and Other Lines

Proceeding sentence by sentence, city by city, and backwards in time, poet and essayist Kazim Ali details the struggle of coming of age between cultures, overcoming personal and family strictures to talk about private affairs and secrets long held. The text is comprised of sentences that alternate in time, ranging from discursive essay to memoir to prose poetry. Art, history, politics, geography, love, sexuality, writing, and religion, and the role silence plays in each, are its interwoven themes. Bright Felon is literally ""autobiography"" because the text itself becomes a form of writing the life, revealing secrets, and then, amid the shards and fragments of experience, dealing with the aftermath of such revelations. Bright Felon offers a new and active form of autobiography alongside such texts as Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Lyn Hejinian's My Life, and Etel Adnan's In the Heart of the Heart of Another Country.

Well before Robin Morgan was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet, and in 1979 she received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry. Monster, her first collection, originally published in 1972, contains work that will astonish, disorient, and move readers in powerful ways.
But Monsteris more than just a book; it has become a phenomenon. Written at a time of political turmoil during the birth of contemporary feminism, the title poem was adopted by women as the anthem of the women's movement; it was chanted at demonstrations and some of its lines became slogans. ""Arraignment"" stirred an international controversy over Ted Hughes's influence on Sylvia Plath's suicide--complete with lawsuits, the banning of this book, and the publication of underground, pirated feminist editions, all of which Morgan reveals in her new preface.
From her well-wrought poems in classical forms to the searing energy and poignant lyricism of the longer, later ones, Morgan's work when it was first released spoke to women hungry for validation of their own reality--and the book sold thirty thousand copies in hardcover alone in its first six months, which was unheard of for poetry.

""America's favorite poet.""--The Wall Street Journal
From the two-term Poet Laureate of the United States Billy Collins comes his first volume of new and selected poems in twelve years. Aimless Lovecombines fifty new poems with generous selections from his four most recent books--Nine Horses, The Trouble with Poetry, Ballistics, andHoroscopes for the Dead. Collins's unmistakable voice, which brings together plain speech with imaginative surprise, is clearly heard on every page, reminding us how he has managed to enrich the tapestry of contemporary poetry and greatly expand its audience. His work is featured in top literary magazines such as The New Yorker, Poetry, and The Atlantic, and he sells out reading venues all across the country. Appearing regularly in The Best American Poetryseries, his poems appeal to readers and live audiences far and wide and have been translated into more than a dozen languages. By turns playful, ironic, and serious, Collins's poetry captures the nuances of everyday life while leading the reader into zones of inspired wonder. In the poet's own words, he hopes that his poems ""begin in Kansas and end in Oz."" Touching on the themes of love, loss, joy, and poetry itself, these poems showcase the best work of this ""poet of plenitude, irony, and Augustan grace"" (The New Yorker).
Envoy
Go, little book,
out of this house and into the world,
carriage made of paper rolling toward town
bearing a single passenger
beyond the reach of this jittery pen
and far from the desk and the nosy gooseneck lamp.
It is time to decamp,
put on a jacket and venture outside,
time to be regarded by other eyes,
bound to be held in foreign hands.
So off you go, infants of the brain,
with a wave and some bits of fatherly advice:
stay out as late as you like,
don't bother to call or write,
and talk to as many strangers as you can.
Praise for Aimless Love
""[Billy Collins] is able, with precious few words, to make me cry. Or laugh out loud. He is a remarkable artist. To have such power in such an abbreviated form is deeply inspiring.""--J. J. Abrams, The New York Times Book Review
""His work is poignant, straightforward, usually funny and imaginative, also nuanced and surprising. It bears repeated reading and reading aloud.""--The Plain Dealer
""Collins has earned almost rock-star status. . . . He knows how to write layered, subtly witty poems that anyone can understand and appreciate--even those who don't normally like poetry. . . . The Collins in these pages is distinctive, evocative, and knows how to make the genre fresh and relevant.""--The Christian Science Monitor
""Collins's new poems contain everything you've come to expect from a Billy Collins poem. They stand solidly on even ground, chiseled and unbreakable. Their phrasing is elegant, the humor is alive, and the speaker continues to stroll at his own pace through the plainness of American life.""--The Daily Beast
""[Collins's] poetry presents simple observations, which create a shared experience between Collins and his readers, while further revealing how he takes life's everyday humdrum experiences and makes them vibrant.""--The Times Leader

The last poem here, and the longest in the book, undertakes a walking tour of each of Jupiter's four major moons, a scientific excursion that leads into the extravagant precisions of the ""Seven Odes to Seven Natural Processes,"" a lyrical yet literal-minded celebration of some of the earthly forces that uphold and surround us.

8590508,1,US,true,3.61,"Confessio Amantis (""The Lover's Confession"") is a 33,000-line Middle English poem by John Gower, which uses the confession made by an ageing lover to the chaplain of Venus as a frame story for a collection of shorter narrative poems. According to its prologue, it was composed at the request of Richard II. It stands with the works of Chaucer, Langland, and the Pearl poet as one of the great works of late 14th-century English literature. The Index of Middle English Verse shows that in the era before the printing press it was one of the most-often copied manuscripts (59 copies) along with Canterbury Tales (72 copies) and Piers Plowman (63 copies).
In genre it is usually considered a poem of consolation, a medieval form inspired by Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy and typified by works such as Pearl. Despite this, it is more usually studied alongside other tale collections with similar structures, such as the Decameron of Boccaccio, and particularly Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, with which the Confessio has several stories in common.

23645006,1,US,true,4.0,"In the 1950s, Yale University Press published a number of Gertrude Stein's posthumous works, among them her incomparable ""Stanzas in Meditation."" Since that time, scholars have discovered that Stein's poem exists in several versions: a manuscript that Stein wrote and two typescripts that her partner Alice B. Toklas prepared. Toklas's work on the second typescript changed the poem when, enraged upon detecting in it references to a former lover, she not only adjusted the typescript but insisted that Stein make revisions in the original manuscript.
This edition of ""Stanzas in Meditation"" is the first to confront the complicated story of its composition and revision. Through meticulous archival work, the editors present a reliable reading text of Stein's original manuscript, as well as an appendix with the textual variants among the poem's several versions. This record of Stein's multi-layered revisions enables readers to engage more fully with the author's radically experimental poem and also to detect the literary impact of Stein's relationship with Toklas. The editors' preface and poet Joan Retallack's introduction offer insight into the complexities of reading Stein's poetry and the innovative modes of reading that her works require and generate. Students and admirers of Stein will welcome this illuminating new contribution to Stein's oeuvre.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23645006-stanzas-in-meditation,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23645006-stanzas-in-meditation,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,4,43249843,Stanzas in Meditation: The Corrected Edition,Stanzas in Meditation: The Corrected Edition

Acclaimed translator Stephen Mitchell's lithe, muscular rendering allows us to enter an ancient masterpiece as if for the first time, to see how startlingly beautiful, intelligent, and alive it is. His insightful introduction provides a historical, spiritual, and cultural context for this ancient epic, showing that Gilgameshis more potent and fascinating than ever.
Gilgameshdates from as early as 1700 BCE -- a thousand years before the Iliad.Lost for almost two millennia, the eleven clay tablets on which the epic was inscribed were discovered in 1853 in the ruins of Nineveh, and the text was not deciphered and fully translated until the end of the century. When the great poet Rainer Maria Rilke first read Gilgameshin 1916, he was awestruck. ""Gilgameshis stupendous,"" he wrote. ""I consider it to be among the greatest things that can happen to a person.""
The epic is the story of literature's first hero -- the king of Uruk in what is present-day Iraq -- and his journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Gilgamesh discovers that friendship can bring peace to a whole city, that a preemptive attack on a monster can have dire consequences, and that wisdom can be found only when the quest for it is abandoned. In giving voice to grief and the fear of death -- perhaps more powerfully than any book written after it -- in portraying love and vulnerability and the ego's hopeless striving for immortality, the epic has become a personal testimony for millions of readers in dozens of languages.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8454932-gilgamesh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8454932-gilgamesh,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394424618m/8454932.jpg,44,57200665,Gilgamesh: A New English Version,Gilgamesh: A New English Version

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter.[1] The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad, composed in the 8th century BC. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes and gods of Rome and Troy.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21154896-the-aeneid,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21154896-the-aeneid,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,4,288738,The Aeneid,The Aeneid

17612021,5,US,true,4.23,"Sassoon, who lived through World War One and who died in 1967, was, as the introduction to this book tells us, irritated in his later years at always being thought of as a ""war poet"". Understandable perhaps from the point of view of the poet: readers on the other hand might wish to demur. The poems gathered here and chronologically ordered, thereby tracing the course of the war, are an extraordinary testimony to the almost unimaginable experiences of a combatant in that bitter conflict. Moving from the patriotic optimism of the first few poems ("" ... fighting for our freedom, we are free"") to the anguish and anger of the later work (where ""hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists / Flounders in mud ... ""), there comes a point when the reality of trench-warfare and its aftershocks move beyond comprehension: Sassoon knows this, and it becomes a powerful element in his art. As a book, the images have a cumulative relentlessness that make it almost impossible to read more than a few poems in one sitting. Unlike the avant-garde experiments developing in Europe in the first decades of this century, Sassoon's verse is formally conservative--but this was perhaps necessary, for as one reads the poems, one feels that the form, the classically inflected tropes, the metre and rhyme, apart from ironising the rhetoric of glory and battle were necessary techniques for containing the emotion (and indeed, a tone of barely controlled irony may have been the only means by which these angry observations would have been considered publishable at the time). When Sassoon's line begins to fragment, as it does in several of the later poems, it is under the extreme pressure to express the inexpressible. Compassion and sympathy are omnipresent here, in their full etymological sense of suffering with or alongside others--something the higher echelons of command (those "" ... old men who died / Slow, natural deaths--old men with ugly souls"") were never able or willing to contemplate. But Sassoon intuited the future of warfare, could sense that this was not ""the war to end all wars"": the mock-religious invocation of the final poem prefigures the vicious euphemisms of more recent conflicts: ""Grant us the power to prove, by poison gases, / The needlessness of shedding human blood."" Sassoon's bile-black irony signals a deep-felt pessimism: it was with good reason. --Burhan Tufail",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17612021-the-war-poems-of-siegfried-sassoon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17612021-the-war-poems-of-siegfried-sassoon,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363248925m/17612021.jpg,83,1885129,The War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon,The War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon

Part of an ancient Hindu epic poem, the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita takes place on a battlefield, where a war for the possession of a North Indian kingdom is about to ensue between two noble families related by blood. The epic's hero, young Prince Arjuna, is torn between his duty as a warrior and his revulsion at the thought of his brothers and cousins killing each other over control of the realm. Frozen by this ethical dilemma, he debates the big questions of life and death with the supreme Hindu deity Krishna, cleverly disguised as his charioteer. By the end of the story, Eastern beliefs about mortality and reincarnation, the vision and practice of yoga, the Indian social order and its responsibilities, family loyalty, spiritual knowledge, and the loftiest pursuits of the human heart are explored in depth.

A surreal journey into obsessions and aberrations of the modern world
and the darker side, which often takes control of the situation.
Madness, violence, aberrant sex, war, hallucinations, sadism, disturbing archetypes,
These are the black fruits of human loneliness.
These are the bloody roots of Eden Underground
""Eden Underground delivers an intense and visually stunning collection
of horror scenarios. Rich in eldritch dreams and manic visions
these poems get under your skin.
Manzetti is a maestro of the dark fantastic.""
- Bruce Boston, author of Resonance Dark and Light
Eden Underground is a surreal journey into obsessions and aberrations of the modern world and its darker side, which often takes control of the situation. Madness, violence, aberrant sex, war, hallucinations, sadism, disturbing archetypes: these are the black fruits of human loneliness, these are the bloody roots of Eden Underground.
In this untold world, men and women build their deformed, artificial underground Eden, where they can unleash their dark side.
Death is the hidden queen of these strange places designed by human alienation: harem of silicone dolls who come to life, abandoned warehouses with copper tubs full of broken pieces of Eve, a bloody collection of copies of the first primordial woman, imaginary worlds inspired by the ghosts of the drug, small Eden dug into the bowels of the sand of war, trenches for refuge from too much horror, the religious fanaticisms and their heretics and violent Eden stained with blood, open air glittering brothels turned into landfills of souls and lost loves.
Haven't you ever heard the loneliness knocking at your door? Or the steps of our dark side, freed from the body and the cage of our conscience, that is coming to take us with a shimmering cleaver in its hand? In Eden Underground you can hear all these ghostly noises, too real, too close.

11359818,1,US,true,4.05,"The Kalevala is the great Finnish epic, which like the Iliad and the Odyssey, grew out of a rich oral tradition with prehistoric roots. During the first millenium of our era, speakers of Uralic languages (those outside the Indo-European group) who had settled in the Baltic region of Karelia, that straddles the border of eastern Finland and north-west Russia, developed an oral poetry that was to last into the nineteenth century. This poetry provided the basis of the Kalevala. It was assembled in the 1840s by the Finnish scholar Elias Lonnrot, who took `dictation' from the performance of a folk singer, in much the same way as our great collections from the past, from Homeric poems to medieval songs and epics, have probably been set down. Published in 1849, it played a central role in the march towards Finnish independence and inspired some of Sibelius's greatest works.

""Shaughnessy's voice is smart, sexy, self-aware, hip . . . consistently wry, and ever savvy.""--Harvard Review
Brenda Shaughnessy's heartrending third collection explores dark subjects--trauma, childbirth, loss of faith--and stark questions: What is the use of pain and grief? Is there another dimension in which our suffering might be transformed? Can we change ourselves? Yearning for new gods, new worlds, and new rules, she imagines a parallel existence in the galaxy of Andromeda.
From ""Our Andromeda"":
Cal, faster than the lightest light,
so much faster than love,
and our Andromeda, that dream,
I can feel it living in us like we
are its home. Like it remembers us
from its own childhood.
Oh, maybe, Cal, we arehome,
if God will let us live here,
with Andromeda inside us,
doesn't it seem we belong?
Now and then, will you help me belong
here, in this place where you became
my child, and I your mother

The wandering poet has always been a feature of our cultural imagination. Odysseus journeys home, his famous flair for storytelling seducing friend and foe. The Romantic poets tramped all over the Lake District searching for inspiration. Now Simon Armitage, with equal parts enthusiasm and trepidation, as well as a wry humor all his own, has taken on Britain's version of our Appalachian Trail: the Pennine Way. Walking ""the backbone of England"" by day (accompanied by friends, family, strangers, dogs, the unpredictable English weather, and a backpack full of Mars Bars), each evening he gives a poetry reading in a different village in exchange for a bed. Armitage reflects on the inextricable link between freedom and fear as well as the poet's place in our bustling world. In Armitage's own words, ""to embark on the walk is to surrender to its lore and submit to its logic, and to take up a challenge against the self.""",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18741024-walking-home,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18741024-walking-home,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383124110m/18741024.jpg,100,19446633,Walking Home: A Poet's Journey,Walking Home: A Poet's Journey

An excerpt from BOOK I The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles--Achilles withdraws from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help the Trojans--Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus. Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another. And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs. ""Sons of Atreus,"" he cried, ""and all other Achaeans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."" On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. ""Old man,"" said he, ""let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.""",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13182616-the-iliad-of-homer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13182616-the-iliad-of-homer,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,15,3293141,The Iliad of Homer,The Iliad of Homer

17379929,11,US,true,4.32,"Anne Carson's Autobiography of Redis a novel in verse, the author's first. A classicist by profession as well as a poet, Carson has drawn on antiquity for her cast, updating the myth of Geryon and Herakles. In the original version, of course, Herakles killed the red-skinned, winged Geryon. In Carson's very contemporary retelling, he merely inspires, but does not return, the monster's passion. By choosing Geryon as her central character, Carson can bring up the questions of existence as if they hadn't been asked before. After all, the monster's instincts have not been numbed by civilization. Fires twist through him. We feel the pain of learning the most elementary things, and then the volcanic intensity that comes with that more advanced thing, love. Yet Carson doesn't so much tell the story of Geryon's love as mediate his very being through semiological surfaces: cafes, video stores, lipstick, a library where he shelves government documents with a ""forlorn austerity, / tall and hushed in their ranges as veterans of a forgotten war."" Carson seldom satisfies herself with an image of the world. Instead she atomizes the world, leaving it broken down, refracted, and glinting. At times her verbal pyrotechnics manage to render pure energy: A little button at the end of each range activated the fluorescent track above it.
A yellowing 5 x 7 index card
Scotch-taped below each button said EXTINGUISH LIGHT WHEN NOT IN USE.
Geryon went flickering
through the ranges like a bit of mercury flipping the switches on and off.
The librarians thought him
a talented boy with a shadow side.
No novelist could have gotten away with that last line. Yet it's very much to the point: Carson's Geryon is, among other things, a camera freak who doesn't understand that an observer must inevitably alter the nature of the thing observed. Here is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, cheek-by-jowl with the ancients!

The acclaimed translator of the Tao Te Ching and the Bhagavad Gita now takes on the oldest book in the world. Inscribed on stone tablets a thousand years before the Iliad and the Bible and found in fragments, Gilgamesh describes the journey of the king of the city of Uruk in what is now Iraq.At the start, Gilgamesh is a young giant with gigantic wealth, power and beauty--and a boundless arrogance that leads him to oppress his people. As an answer to their pleas, the gods create Enkidu to be a double for Gilgamesh, a second self. Learning of this huge, wild man who runs with the animals, Gilgamesh dispatches a priestess to find him and tame him by seducing him. Making love with the priestess awakens Enkidu's consciousness of his true identity as a human being rather than as an animal. Enkidu is taken to the city and to Gilgamesh, who falls in love with him as a soul mate. Soon, however, Gilgamesh takes his beloved friend with him to the Cedar Forest to kill the guardian, the monster Humbaba, in defiance of the gods. Enkidu dies as a result. The overwhelming grief and fear of death that Gilgamesh suffers propels him on a quest for immortality that is as fast-paced and thrilling as a contemporary action film. In the end, Gilgamesh returns to his city. He does not become immortal in the way he thinks he wants to be, but he is able to embrace what is.Relying on existing translations (and in places where there are gaps, on his own imagination), Mitchell seeks language that is as swift and strong as the story itself. He conveys the evenhanded generosity of the original poet, who is as sympathetic toward women and monsters--and the whole range of human emotions and desires--as he is toward his heroes. This wonderful new version of the story of Gilgamesh shows how the story came to achieve literary immortality--not because it is a rare ancient artifact, but because reading it can make people in the here and now feel more completely alive.

You know those ..... drifting kinds of thoughts? When it's easy to believe that someone else is dreaming you? Well that's Trance Poetry.
The purpose of the poems in this book are to try and show how words alone can lift you up and take you places, how they can enchant and bewitch, creating the illusion that just for a few minutes everything's alright with the world.
When I started to write poetry I searched around for subject matter, and chose colour. Not yellow, red and blue, but Paprika, Jet, Ochre, Huckleberry Blue, Fiesta etc. and went inside trying to see where that 'colour' would take me. From this I created a series of poems which I entitled Colour-oetry, and I've included these here as well.
Only half of this book is poetry, well 56% to be precise. A while ago I took an interest in the parallel lives of the chef and the writer. How the chef creates his magic in the chaotic environment of the kitchen compares well with how the writer creates his hocus-pocus in the peace and quiet of his study. A chef's wizardry is in his ingredients, whilst a writer's sorcery is in his words. So I wrote a few chapters on food, following it all over the world at one stage, attempting to paint pictures with my words. But I also focused on the 'writer,' comparing him or her not only to the chef but also to other master tradesmen, even a bricklayer at one stage.
Deep down this is the purpose of this book, to discuss the art of the writer and the sorcery in his words. Whether I've succeeded or not, only the reader can tell.
I've finished the book with three chapters on parenting experiences. True stories actually. My goal here is to use the writer's sorcery to establish emotion and hopefully leave you with a lump in your throat.

""Bass tries to convey everyday wonder on contemporary experiences of sex, work, aging, and war. Those who turn to poetry to become confidants for another's stories and secrets will not be disappointed.""--Publishers Weekly
""In her fifth book of poetry, Bass addresses everything from Saturn's rings and Newton's law of gravitation to wasps and Pablo Neruda. Her words are nostalgic, vivid, and visceral. Bass arrives at the truth of human carnality rooted in the extraordinary need and promise of the individual. Bass shows us that we are as radiant as we are ephemeral, that in transience glistens resilient history and the remarkable fluidity of connection. By the collection's end--following her musings on suicide and generosity, desire and repetition--it becomes lucidly clear that Bass is not only a poet but also a philosopher and a storyteller.""--Booklist
Ellen Bass brings a deft touch as she continues her ongoing interrogations of crucial moral issues of our times, while simultaneously delighting in endearing human absurdities. From the start of Like a Beggar, Bass asks her readers to relax, even though ""bad things are going to happen,"" because the ""bad"" gets mined for all manner of goodness.

After dinner, we're drinking scotch at the kitchen table.
Janet and I just watched a NOVA special
and we're explaining to her mother
the age and size of the universe--
the hundred billion stars in the hundred billion galaxies.
Dotty lives at Dominican Oaks, making her way down the long hall.
How about the sun? she asks, a little farmshit in the endlessness.
I gather up a cantaloupe, a lime, a cherry,
and start revolving this salad around the chicken carcass.
This is the best scotch I ever tasted, Dotty says,
even though we gave her the Maker's Mark
while we're drinking Glendronach...

One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. His major works are: Olney Hymns (1779), in collaboration with John Newton, John Gilpin (1782), The Task (1785), and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (1791) (translations from the Greek). He suffered from periods of severe depression, and although he found refuge in a fervent evangelical Christianity, the source of his much-loved hymns, he often experienced doubt and fears that he was doomed to eternal damnation.

With the sort of smart, persuasive voice associated with Simon Armitage and Michael Donaghy, these poems worry at the world in search of consolation, or else meet life's absurdity and strangeness half-way; whether sitting proudly atop an unexploded bomb, or injecting blood under the skin of a banana, playfulness and imagination are vehicles for confronting 'the fearful and forgotten things I've lied to myself about'. Here are poems which address anxiety about fatherhood, remorse for lost lovers and friends, or mourn for a miscarried sibling.
Happinessis a collection preoccupied with the ephemerality of happiness itself, at the ever-present possibility of its departure, and the ways we try to grasp and keep hold of it. 'Every single thought I'm having is about LOVE', here meaning both the pleasure and panic of love, its peculiarity; love as a feeling of risk, love for one's own body, familiar yet estranged, of 'cack-handed LOVE at his console', love like 'pausing to move a snail somewhere safer in the rain'.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25854187-happiness,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25854187-happiness,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,51,45722570,Happiness,Happiness

There are four of them: I Am What I Am; I, Woman; The Hollow; and The One Who Never Leaves. Here, you will come into a dark, strange world, a hyper-reality where nearly everything is firmly rooted in the familiar--except for some quirky detail that twists the yarn, and takes it for a spin in an unexpected direction.
This is the reality you will see through the eyes of a ghost of a woman, trying to reclaim her name by appealing to the devil; the eyes of a clay figure of a woman, about to be fired in the kiln, longing for her Creator; the eyes of a woman in the midst of a free fall, about to become a ghost; and the eyes of a feline creature with cracked fangs, trying in vain to resign herself, by hook and by crook, to being locked. These characters explore their identity, and challenge their fate.
Inspired by her art, by quotes from literature and the bible, and by the author's professional career, these tales come from different times and places. Yet all of them share one thing in common: an unusual mind, one that is twisted.

9467711,6,US,true,3.74,"Judith Viorst returns with more poems in her ""Decades"" poetry series detailing the highs and lows of being an octogenarian. Continuing the comedic insight from I'm Too Young to be Seventy, these verses of memories and advice from eighty years of love, marriage, and grandchildren are sure to bring laughs.
What does it mean to be eighty? In her wise and playful poems, Judith Viorst discusses love, friendship, grand parenthood, and all the particular marvels--and otherwise--of this extraordinary decade. She describes the wonder of seeing the world with new eyes--not because of revelation but because of a successful cataract operation. She promises not to gently fade away, and not to drive after daylight's faded away either. She explains how she's gotten to be a ""three-desserts"" grandmother (""Just don't tell your mom!""), shares how memory failure can keep you married, and enumerates her hopes for the afterlife (which she doesn't believe in, but if it does exist, her sister-in-law better not be there with her).
As Viorst gleefully attests, eighty is not too old to dream, to flirt, to drink, and to dance. It's also not too late to give up being cheap or to take up with a younger man of seventy-eight. Zesty, hopeful, and full of the pleasures of living, Viorst's poems speak to her legions of readers, who recognize themselves in her knowing observations, in her touching reflections, and in her joyful affirmations. Funny, moving, inspirational, and true--the newest in Judith Viorst's beloved ""decades"" series extols the virtues, victories, frustrations, and joys of life.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9467711-unexpectedly-eighty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9467711-unexpectedly-eighty,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,30,14352771,Unexpectedly Eighty: And Other Adaptations,Unexpectedly Eighty: And Other Adaptations

In the beginning I was so young and such a stranger to myself I hardly existed. I had to go out into the world and see it and hear it and react to it, before I knew at all who I was, what I was, what I wanted to be.
So beginsUpstream, a collection of essays in which reveredpoet Mary Oliver reflects on her willingness, as a young child and as an adult, to lose herself within the beauty and mysteries of both the natural world and the world of literature. Emphasizing the significance of her childhood friend Walt Whitman, through whose work she first understood that a poem is a temple, a place to enter, and in which to feel, and who encouraged her to vanish into the world of her writing, Oliver meditates on the forces that allowed her to create a life for herself out of work and love. As she writes, I could not be a poet without the natural world. Someone else could. But not me. For me the door to the woods is the door to the temple.
Upstreamfollows Oliver as she contemplates the pleasure of artistic labor, her boundless curiosity for the flora and fauna that surround her, and the responsibility she has inherited from Shelley, Wordsworth, Emerson, Poe, and Frost, the great thinkers and writers of the past, to live thoughtfully, intelligently, and to observe with passion. Throughout this collection, Oliver positions not just herself upstream but us as well as she encourages us all to keep moving, to lose ourselves in the awe of the unknown, and to give power and time to the creative and whimsical urges that live within us.""",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32889506-upstream,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32889506-upstream,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1478646094m/32889506.jpg,6,49602235,Upstream: Select Essays,Upstream: Select Essays

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter.[1] The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad, composed in the 8th century BC. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes and gods of Rome and Troy.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284355-the-aeneid,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284355-the-aeneid,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,55,288738,The Aeneid,The Aeneid

""Harrison inhabits the problems of our age as if they were beasts into which he had crawled, and Letters to Yeseninis a kind of imaginative taxidermy that refuses to stay in place up on the trophy room wall, but insists on walking into the dining room.""-The American Poetry Review
Jim Harrison's gorgeous, desperate, and harrowing ""correspondence"" with Sergei Yesenin-a Russian poet who committed suicide after writing his final poem in his own blood-is considered an American masterwork.
In the early 1970s, Harrison was living in poverty on a hardscrabble farm, suffering from depression and suicidal tendencies. In response he began to write daily prose-poem letters to Yesenin. Through this one-sided correspondence, Harrison unloads to this unlikely hero, ranting and raving about politics, drinking problems, family concerns, farm life, and a full range of daily occurrences. The rope remains ever present.
Yet sometime through these letters there is a significant shift. Rather than feeling inextricably linked to Yesenin's inevitable path, Harrison becomes furious, arguing about their imagined relationship: ""I'm beginning to doubt whether we ever would have been friends.""
In the end, Harrison listened to his own poems: ""My year-old daughter's red robe hangs from the doorknob shouting Stop.""",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197131.Letters_To_Yesenin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197131.Letters_To_Yesenin,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418906288m/197131.jpg,120,1584636,Letters To Yesenin,Letters To Yesenin

A sandbanked strand to sink a fleet,
A bay, a bar, a strip, a trap, 
A wrecking ground, that's Shingle Street.'
Blake Morrison's first two collections, Dark Glasses(1984) and The Ballad of a Yorkshire Ripper(1987) established him as one of our most inventive and accomplished contemporary poets.
In his first full-length collection for nearly thirty years, Shingle Streetsees a return to the form with which he started his career. Set along the Suffolk coast, the opening poems address a receding world - an eroding landscape, 'abashed by the ocean's passion'. But coastal life gives way to other, more dangerous, vistas: a wave unleashes a flood-tide of terror; a sequence of topical poems lays bare pressing political issues;while elsewhere portraits of the past bring forth the dear and the departed.
Ardent and elegiac, and encompassing an impressive range of mood and method, this is a timely offering from a poet of distinct talents.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24859189-shingle-street,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24859189-shingle-street,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,15,42905504,Shingle Street,Shingle Street

Taking into account that Whitman did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself, the editors of this reproduction, paid special attention not only to text itself but also to an authentic reproduction of pagination, paragraphing and linebreaks. LEAVES OF GRASS is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819-1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing LEAVES OF GRASS, revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades-the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29150702-leaves-of-grass,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29150702-leaves-of-grass,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,3,28117,Leaves of Grass (Wisehouse Classics - Authentic Reproduction of the 1855 First Edition),Leaves of Grass (Wisehouse Classics - Authentic Reproduction of the 1855 First Edition)

While waiting for the light to change, I saw the following public service announcement on the side of a bus: "" Omoiyari hitonikurumani konomachini ""(Sympathy / toward people, toward cars / toward this town). Seventeen syllables. Five-seven-five format. It must be a haiku, I thought. But when I reached the office and repeated the announcement to my Japanese coworkers, none of them thought it was a haiku. I knew they were thinking to themselves, "" What kind of a lunatic is she? ""One tried to break the news to me gently, "" It's not a haiku, it's an advertising jingle. ""Well, I knew it was an advertising jingle, but still, wasn't it an advertising jingle"" haiku?--From ""The Haiku Apprentice""
Abigail Friedman was an American diplomat in Tokyo, not a writer. A chance encounter leads her to a haiku group, where she discovers poetry that anyone can enjoy writing. Her teacher and fellow haiku group members instruct her in seasonal flora and fauna, and gradually she learns to describe the world in plain words, becoming one of the millions in Japan who lead a haiku life. This is the author's story of her literary and cultural voyage, and more: it is an invitation to readers to form their own neighborhood haiku groups and, like her, learn to see the world anew.

Not by the sun's rays, nor the bright shafts of day,
Must be dispersed, as is most necessary,
But by the face of nature and her laws.'
Lucretius' poem On the Nature of the Universecombines a scientific and philosophical treatise with some of the greatest poetry ever written. With intense moral fervour Lucretius demonstrates to humanity that in death there is nothing to fear since the soul is mortal, and the world and everything in it is governed not by the gods, but by the mechanical laws of nature. By believing this, men can live in peace of mind and happiness. Lucretius bases his argument on the atomic theory expounded by the Greek philosopher Epicurus. His poem explores sensation, sex, cosmology, meteorology, and geology through acute observation of the beauties of the natural world and with moving sympathy for man's place in it.
Sir Ronald Melville's accessible and accurate verse translation is complemented by an introduction and notes situating Lucretius' scientific theories within the thought of 1st century BCE Rome and discussing the Epicurean philosophy that was his inspiration and why the issues Lucretius' poem raisies about the scientific and poetical views of the world continue to be important.

During this season, religious as well as nonaffiliated Jews attend synagogue services in unparalleled numbers. Yet much of what they find there can be unwelcoming in its patriarchal imagery, leaving many worshipers unsatisfied.
For those seeking to connect more deeply with their Judaism, and for all readers in search of a contemplative approach to the themes of the fall season, poet and scholar Marcia Falk re-creates the holidays' key prayers and rituals from an inclusive perspective. Among the offerings in The Days Between are Hebrew and English blessings for festive meals, prayers for synagogue services, and poems and meditations for quiet reflection. Emphasizing introspection as well as relationship to others, Falk evokes her vision of the High Holidays as ""ten days of striving to keep the heart open to change.""
Accessible and welcoming to modern readers, The Days Between is steeped in traditional sources and grounded in liturgical and biblical scholarship.

The underground Internet sensation, J. Andrew Haknort, is finally available for your Kindle reader thingy, so you don't have to kill yourself!
What? Haven't heard of the Woobie Award winning poetry of Haknort?
He was voted the worst poet in history, by people who vote for things like that, probably when they should be working instead of screwing around with Internet polls. Your boss knows you slack off. He's got a little tracker bot on your computer, so he sees how often you check your Facebook page. He's also got a spy cam in the washroom.
Where were we? Oh yeah. The ebook.
This ebook collection of over one thousand terrible, offensive, vulgar, dirty, politically incorrect bad poems and awful jokes is just the thing to brighten up your miserable life.
Unless you're easily offended. Then you shouldn't buy this. Spend your money on something better for your soul. Like meth. Or bullets.
But... if you can handle extreme bad taste, and you're the type of person who has a bunch of goofy friends who like to get drunk and play ""handtool dodgeball,"" then this may be the book you've been searching for your whole miserable life.
This ebook contains hundreds and hundreds of hilariously awful poems and gut-busting jokes. Plus it's fat free. And it makes you more attractive. And it cures warts.
Plus, it's pretty funny. Not funny like your Aunt Zelda, who your parents put in a home because she thought the squirrels were plotting against her. This ebook is haha funny.
In fact, this is 100% guaranteed to make you wet your pants laughing. If you don't wet your pants, we'll send someone over to wet them for you.
Come on! Buy it already! You got something better to do with your pocket change? Maybe head on over to the vending machine for a little snack action? Save yourself an angioplasty, chubbo, and spend your lousy buck on this book instead.
Or maybe you're thinking of saving your pennies for the jukebox. If so, you're probably over 50. Jukebox? Get an iPod, Gramps! Join the 21st century!
The fact is, there isn't a single thing you can spend your money on that will give you more enjoyment than this crappy little ebook poetry collection. Except maybe feeder mice. They get so freaked-out when you drop them in the aquarium with your pet snake, and they run around all scared, but where are you going to run, little Mr. Mouse? You're stuck in an aquarium! You can see through the walls of your glass prison but you can't escape!
Snakes are cool.
If you took all the snakes in the world, and laid them all end to end, it would probably take a lot of time.

We're not telling you anything else that will be helpful. Other than the fact that this is CHEAP.

Ebooks are a bunch of ones and zeros. They cost nothing to produce or send. So why the hell are some bestselling authors charging $11.99 for a Kindle version? Aren't they rich enough yet? How many Porsches do you need, writer boy?
They should GIVE THE BOOKS AWAY FOR FREE!

18209587,7,US,true,4.42,"Du Fu (712-770) is one of the undisputed geniuses of Chinese poetry--still universally admired and read thirteen centuries after his death. Now David Young, author of Black Lab, and well known as a translator of Chinese poets, gives us a sparkling new translation of Du Fu's verse, arranged to give us a tour of the life, each ""chapter"" of poems preceded by an introductory paragraph that situates us in place, time, and circumstance. What emerges is a portrait of a modest yet great artist, an ordinary man moving and adjusting as he must in troubled times, while creating a startling, timeless body of work.
Du Fu wrote poems that engaged his contemporaries and widened the path of the lyric poet. As his society--one of the world's great civilizations--slipped from a golden age into chaos, he wrote of the uncertain course of empire, the misfortunes and pleasures of his own family, the hard lives of ordinary people, the changing seasons, and the lives of creatures who shared his environment. As the poet chases chickens around the yard, observes tear streaks on his wife's cheek, or receives a gift of some shallots from a neighbor, Young's rendering brings Du Fu's voice naturally and elegantly to life.
I sing what comes to me
in ways both old and modern
my only audience right now--
nearby bushes and trees
elegant houses stand
in an elegant row, too many
if my heart turns to ashes
then that's all right with me . . .

25981438,1,US,true,4.14,"The colour red infuses Kissing Keeps Us Afloat as blood, anger, and love infiltrate our lives. Red flows as wondrous crayons shading in the shape of a life lived passionately. With flashes of humour and the occasional playful rhyme, Laurie MacFayden urges us to keep loving, losing, caring, and colouring. Not always with the red crayons, but these poems remind us to keep those ones -- in their hues of crimson and lust -- well-sharpened. -- Kimmy Beach
""Swinging and searing verses, meditative narratives, honky-tonk tunes and catalogues of favoured things (including what lovers bring -- or leave behind), all merge to make Kissing Keeps Us Afloat a book for tongues and lips to sing. MacFayden knows painting and music, and she loves words and women. The result is art without limit, craft without regret, and poetry that faces trauma and embraces the erotic. MacFayden tells us, ""some days,"" a poet ""will swagger home with roses; / some days, she will stagger home with thorns."" Because her heart and mind are open to hurts and salves, the poet both suffers and exults. She sets her eyes-and sights-directly on bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, beaches, forest glades, motels, streets, and all the passion plays and comedies enacted in these places. Thus, she shows us that home is where the lover is, and home is where love is born, ""hidden ... in mitochondrial strands"" or even in ""the intimate seams of some underthings."" MacFayden's poetry is both red-hot and cool-blue, white lies and film noir, memory and truth. In the supposed mundane, she shows us, transcendence awaits."" -- George Elliott Clarke

Yet it remains one of the most characteristic and delightful of Euripidean dramas, as well as, by modern standards, the most easily actable.

12014781,2,US,true,4.21,"The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson, by Emily Dickinson, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classicsseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:
All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.
Born in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1830, Dickinsonbegan life as an energetic, outgoing young woman who excelled as a student. However, in her mid-twenties she began to grow reclusive, and eventually she rarely descended from her room in her father's house. She spent most of her time working on her poetry, largely without encouragement or real interest from her family and peers, and died at age fifty-five. Only a handful of her 1,775 poems had been published during her lifetime. When her poems finally appeared after her death, readers immediately recognized an artist whose immense depth and stylistic complexities would one day make her the most widely recognized female poet to write in the English language. Dickinson's poetry is remarkable for its tightly controlled emotional and intellectual energy. The longest poem covers less than two pages. Yet in theme and tone her writing reaches for the sublime as it charts the landscape of the human soul. A true innovator, Dickinson experimented freely with conventional rhythm and meter, and often used dashes, off rhymes, and unusual metaphors--techniques that strongly influenced modern poetry. Dickinson's idiosyncratic style, along with her deep resonance of thought and her observations about life and death, love and nature, and solitude and society, have firmly established her as one of America's true poetic geniuses.

'So the company of men led a careless life,
All was well with them: until One began
To encompass evil, an enemy from hell.
Grendel they called this cruel spirit...'
J.R.R. Tolkien spent much of his life studying, translating and teaching the great epic stories of northern Europe, filled with heroes, dragons, trolls, dwarves and magic. He was hugely influential for his advocacy of Beowulfas a great work of literature and, even if he had never written The Hobbitand The Lord of the Rings, would be recognised today as a significant figure in the rediscovery of these extraordinary tales.
Legends from the Ancient North brings together from Penguin Classics five of the key works behind Tolkien's fiction.They are startling, brutal, strange pieces of writing, with an elemental power brilliantly preserved in these translations.They plunge the reader into a world of treachery, quests, chivalry, trials of strength.They are the most ancient narratives that exist from northern Europe and bring us as near as we will ever get to the origins of the magical landscape of Middle-earth (Midgard) which Tolkien remade in the 20th century.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18916061-the-wanderer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18916061-the-wanderer,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420793584m/18916061.jpg,25,24819327,"The Wanderer: Elegies, Epics, Riddles","The Wanderer: Elegies, Epics, Riddles"

17910294,19,US,true,4.17,"Winner of the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for biography and of the Plutarch Award for the Best Biography of 2013. National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist. To readers who know Marianne Moore as a demure baseball fan and courtly Brooklyn eccentric, Linda Leavell's _Holding On Upside Down_--the first authorized biography of this major American poet--will come as a shock. This mesmerizing, essential new book will change forever how we view the woman and her poetry. Drawing on previously untapped depths in the Moore family archives, _Holding On Upside Down_ reveals a passionate, canny young woman caught between genuine devotion to her hovering mother, with whom she lived for sixty years, and her own irrepressible desire for freedom. The radically original verse she wrote in the early twentieth century baffled her family at the same time it both confounded and dazzled her literary peers. Her many poems about survival, it turns out, are not just quirky nature studies but acts of survival themselves. Leavell places this mother/daughter drama within a historical context of emerging modernity. Reared among single, educated women like her mother, the poet embraced feminism and progressive era ideals from early adolescence. ""Everyone loved her,"" recalled William Carlos Williams of the years she lived in Greenwich Village, yet no one could fathom the ""mother thing,"" as he called it. After her mother's death decades later, the aging recluse transformed herself, against all expectations, into a charismatic performer and beloved celebrity who was widely hailed as America's greatest living poet. Elegantly written, meticulously researched, and critically acute, _Holding On Upside Down_ provides at last the biography that this major modernist and complex personality deserves.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910294-holding-on-upside-down,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910294-holding-on-upside-down,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412577433m/17910294.jpg,62,25095813,Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore,Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore

Despite being one of the most influential - and best-loved - of the post-war English writers, Angela Carter remains little-known as a poet. In Unicorn, the critic and historian Rosemary Hill collects together her published verse from 1963-1971, a period in which Carter began to explore the themes that dominated her later work: magic, the reworking of myths and their darker sides, and the overturning of literary and social conventions. With imagery at times startling in its violence and disconcerting in its presentation of sexuality, Unicorn provides compelling insight into the formation of a remarkable imagination.

The story chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother Qizil Arsalan. It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of Sassanian Khosrow II Parviz towards his Armenian princess Shirin. ""Khusrow and Shirin"" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad. The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity. Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love.
The influence of Vis o Ramin is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Ramin, as well as being in the same meter (hazaj) as Gorgani's poem. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Ramin. In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made.

Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud est un poete francais, ne le 20 octobre 1854 a Charleville et mort le 10 novembre 1891 a Marseille. Arthur Rimbaud ecrit ses premiers poemes a quinze ans. Lui, pour qui le poete doit etre <>et qui proclame qu'il faut <>, renonce subitement a l'ecriture a l'age de vingt ans. Ses idees marginales, anti-bourgeoises et libertaires le poussent a choisir une vie aventureuse, dont les peregrinations l'amenent jusqu'au Yemen et en Ethiopie, ou il devient negociant, voire explorateur. De cette seconde vie, ses ecritures consistent surtout en de nombreuses lettres (correspondance familiale et professionnelle). Bien que breve, la densite de son oeuvre poetique fait d'Arthur Rimbaud une des figures considerables de la litterature francaise.

Die Bruder Grimm; Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859), were German academics, linguists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors - who together specialized in collecting and publishing folklore during the nineteenth century. The popularity of their collected tales has endured well; they have been translated into more than 100 languages, and remain in print in the present day. This is a text to be appreciated by young and old alike; extraordinary for its literary as well as artistic significance.

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the Taleshas been translated into modern idiom. From the heroic romance of ""The Knight's Tale"" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant.

Rae Armantrout has always organized her collections of poetry as though they were works in themselves. Versed brings two of these sequences together, offering readers an expanded view of the arc of her writing. The poems in the first section, Versed, play with vice and versa, the perversity of human consciousness. They flirt with error and delusion, skating on a thin ice that inevitably cracks: ""Metaphor forms / a crust / beneath which / the crevasse of each experience."" Dark Matter, the second section, alludes to more than the unseen substance thought to make up the majority of mass in the universe. The invisible and unknowable are confronted directly as Armantrout's experience with cancer marks these poems with a new austerity, shot through with her signature wit and stark unsentimental thinking. Together, the poems of Versed part us from our assumptions about reality, revealing the gaps and fissures in our emotional and linguistic constructs, showing us ourselves where we are most exposed.

Chaucer's 'Parliament of Fowls' is a story about love, lust, honour, nature...and ducks. Simon Webb's highly accessible modern English verse translation conveys the humour and colour of Chaucer's original, and his introduction explains why the poem is now considered to be the work that first introduced the idea of Valentine's Day as we know it.

It is a minimalist epic telling of the abduction of Gerdur Gymisdottir from the land of giants to the court of Freyr of the 'wolf-grey eyes', and the subsequent events culminating in the birth of her son and her hopes of being saved by her own kin. It is full of iron-hard rocks and ice, serpents in the breast gnawing at the harness of hope, but also wide-reaching fields of corn whispering in the breeze and a throne carved with beasts and dragons-heads.

'Tableaux parisiens' portrays the brutal life of Paris's thieves, drunkards and prostitutes amid the debris of factories and poorhouses. In love poems such as 'Le Beau Navire', flights of lyricism entwine with languorous eroticism, while prose poems such as 'La Chambre Double' deal with the agonies of artistic creation and mortality.

French Underground, and fell in love with an American doctor in Paris. And
throughout her too-short lifetime, she recorded her innermost thoughts and
impressions with intensely personal poems.
The daughter of a French physician, Lucienne Hollard McKay's poetry reflects
many of her thoughts, her moods, her intimations. In them one finds pain as
well as gaiety; and fantasy, delight, and ecstasy.
Tremendously personal, the poems are set down in the author's native French
and were never intended for publication.
To honor Lucienne's memory after her passing, her husband selected more than
fifty of these poems to share with the world. They appear herein, filled
with all the nuances and delicate iridescence of their original expression.
Translated with dedicated friendship by Lilian Polk, the English poems
appear side-by-side, next to the romantic language in which they were
created.
In these poems, daydreams commingle with reality, life and death are
interwoven, and always there is an ethereal beauty-even in the midst of
tragedy.
Lucienne Hollard knew the mighty and the lowly, enjoyed the society of the
famous, and worked closely with the nameless ones of the French Underground
during World War II. Everywhere her life took her, she remained a dauntless
spirit with an unbounded verve for whatever life brought. No other memorial

In 1919, when C.S. Lewis was only twenty, just a few months returned from the Great War, his first collection of poetry was published, presaging the author's brilliant career. At the time, Lewis was in the midst of his agnostic phase, yet to become the great Christian philosopher of his later life. As such, the poems all revolve around the theme of nature as a malevolent force, with beauty as the only divine truth.
This volume includes a preface by Walter Hooper, which illuminates Lewis's formative influences, drawing from his letters, diaries, and other works to provide a record of the early part of the great writer's life.

When Alice Walker published her second collection of poems in 1976, she had spent the previous decade deeply immersed in the civil rights movement. In these verses are her most visceral reactions to a moment in history that would shape the country, and that she herself influenced through words and advocacy. In hymns to ancestors, passionate polemics, and laments for lost possibilities, Walker addresses the problems of the past while keeping an eye on the possibilities of the future. Even in the midst of the call for change, these poems reveal a deep yearning for individual connection to others, as well as a deeply personal connection to nature.

As former U.S. poet laureate Charles Simic has said, the secret to our identities lies not in grand events, but in the parentheses between events--and in these brief essays, we get a taste of this great poet's parenthetical observations and recollections. He takes us from his rattling house on a stormy New Hampshire night, to a park bench in Washington Square where two old men sit
discussing the women they've known, to a business convention in Topeka where he reads a poem, to the vanished subterranean jazz clubs of old New York, and beyond. Part autobiographical fragment, part waking dream, these pieces are marked by Simic's characteristic wit, audacity, and awe before life's strangeness.

Praise for Mother's Milk
""In these brief and moving poems, Rachel Hunt Steenblik recalls and reimagines the relationship between the daughters of God and their hidden and distant mother. Using her own experience and revelation as well as her wide research, Rachel recreates the Heavenly Mother many dream of knowing, a woman not unlike our own mothers, one who shares our own experience of motherhood."" --Claudia L. Bushman, author of Contemporary Mormonism
""The warm, delicious, delicate and strong poems in Mother's Milk moved and delighted me. Without doubt this book is a major step toward filling the Mother-sized hole in our hearts. Boldly pulling back the curtain of patriarchy to show that ""God"" is not a boy's name and that we have never lived in a one-parent family, Rachel reminds us that our Mother has never ceased to nourish and love us."" --Carol Lynn Pearson, author of Mother Wove the Morning, and The Ghost of Eternal Polygamy
""Rachel Hunt Steenblik is Mormonism's most essential and necessary poet since Carol Lynn Pearson. Out of her hunger for a mother God, she has made food for us all. Out of her losses, she has made milk. It's what women's bodies know how to do, of course. But Rachel, oh honey, few of us do it so openly, so truthfully, so plainly, so well.

John O'Donohue won hundreds of thousands of admirers with his now classic work on Celtic spirituality Anam Cara. Unfortunately he died suddenly at age fifty-two just as his book of blessings, To Bless the Space Between Us, was being published.

As O'Donohue explores a range of themes relating to the way we live our lives today, he reveals how the energy and rhythm of the natural world--its innocence and creativity, its power and splendor--hold profound lessons for us all.

11050763,1,US,true,4.28,"Alongside Wallace Stevens, James Merrill, and other pillars of twentieth-century poetry, Anthony Hecht joins the Borzoi Poetry series.
Hecht, whose writing rings with the cadences of the King James Bible, and who, as an infantryman at the end of World War II, participated in the liberation of the concentration camps, lived and experienced the best and worst of the twentieth century. Readers of this volume--the first selected poems to be made from Hecht's seven individual volumes--will be captivated by Hecht's dark music and allusions to the literature of the past. As J. D. McClatchy explains in his introduction, Hecht was a poet for whom formal elegance was inextricably bound up with the dramatic force, thematic ambition, and powerful emotions in each poem. The rules of his art, which he both honored and transformed, are ""moral principles meant finally to reveal the structure of human dilemmas and sympathies.""
This elevated sense of what poetry can accomplish defines our experience of reading Hecht, and will ensure his place in the canon for years to come.
Adam and Eve knew such perfection once,
God's finger in the cloud, and on the ground
Nothing but springtime, nothing else at all.
But in our fallen state where the blood hunts
For blood, and rises at the hunting sound,
What do we know of lasting since the fall?
Who has not, in the oil and heat of youth,
Thought of the flourishing of the almond tree,
The grasshopper, and the failing of desire,
And thought his tongue might pierce the secrecy
Of the six-pointed starlight, and might choir
A secret-voweled, unutterable truth?

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.Born in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1830, Dickinsonbegan life as an energetic, outgoing young woman who excelled as a student. However, in her mid-twenties she began to grow reclusive, and eventually she rarely descended from her room in her father s house. She spent most of her time working on her poetry, largely without encouragement or real interest from her family and peers, and died at age fifty-five. Only a handful of her 1,775 poems had been published during her lifetime. When her poems finally appeared after her death, readers immediately recognized an artist whose immense depth and stylistic complexities would one day make her the most widely recognized female poet to write in the English language.Dickinson s poetry is remarkable for its tightly controlled emotional and intellectual energy. The longest poem covers less than two pages. Yet in theme and tone her writing reaches for the sublime as it charts the landscape of the human soul. A true innovator, Dickinson experimented freely with conventional rhythm and meter, and often used dashes, off rhymes, and unusual metaphorstechniques that strongly influenced modern poetry. Dickinson s idiosyncratic style, along with her deep resonance of thought and her observations about life and death, love and nature, and solitude and society, have firmly established her as one of America s true poetic geniuses.

The effortless virtuosity, directness, drama and humanity of Carol Ann Duffy's verse have made her our most admired and best-loved contemporary poet. Rapture, her seventh collection, is a book-length love-poem, and a moving act of personal testimony; but what sets these poems apart from other treatments of the subject is that Duffy refuses to simplify the contradictions of love, and read its transformations - infatuation, longing, passion, commitment, rancour, separation and grief - as simply redemptive or destructive.
Raptureis a map of real love, in all its churning complexity. Yet in showing us that a song can be made of even the most painful episodes in our lives, Duffy has accessed a new level of directness that sacrifices nothing in the way of subtlety of expression. These are poems that will find deep rhymes in the experience of most readers, and nowhere has Duffy more eloquently articulated her belief that poetry should speak for us all.""",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19211854-rapture,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19211854-rapture,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,21,399251,Rapture,Rapture

Romance and poetry seem to go hand in hand but - implicit, explicit, nuanced or starkly frank - sex itself has long been a staple subject for poets. In fact a great deal of erotic poetry rejects the distinction. It's hard to imagine a more fruitful subject for poets than sex, in all its glorious manifestations: from desire and hope, through disappointment and confusion, to conclusion and consequence. And little has changed over the centuries, as Sophie Hannah's anthology vividly demonstrates, from Catullus pleading with Lesbos to Walt Whitman singing the body electric. Moods and attitudes may vary but the drive persists as does the desire to write about it. Sophie Hannah's selection ranges from ancient Rome to modern New York, from gay to straight, but her principle has been to go low on the sugar and high on the excitement.

25586155,1,US,true,3.65,"from ""Ozone Journal""
Bach's cantata in B-flat minor in the cassette,
we lounged under the greenhouse-sky, the UVBs hacking
at the acids and oxides and then I could hear the difference
between an oboe and a bassoon
at the river's edge under cover--
trees breathed in our respiration;
there was something on the other side of the river,
something both of us were itching toward--
radical bonds were broken, history became science.
We were never the same.
The title poem of Peter Balakian's Ozone Journalis a sequence of fifty-four short sections, each a poem in itself, recounting the speaker's memory of excavating the bones of Armenian genocide victims in the Syrian desert with a crew of television journalists in 2009. These memories spark others--the dissolution of his marriage, his life as a young single parent in Manhattan in the nineties, visits and conversations with a cousin dying of AIDS--creating a montage that has the feel of history as lived experience. Bookending this sequence are shorter lyrics that span times and locations, from Nairobi to the Native American villages of New Mexico.

EARTH APPLES, his first and only book of poetry, adds to his literary reputation as an irreverent soul. Whether writing about desert landscapes, New York City, or the love of bawdy women, Abbey's verse contains both plaintive eloquence and unapologetic passion. These poems--published for the first time digitally--are culled from Abbey's journals and offer an insightful, unique look into the mind of a literary legend.
Edward Abbey was born in Home, Pennsylvania, in 1927. In 1944, at the age of 17, he set out to explore the American Southwest. Bumming around the country by hitchhiking and hopping freight trains, Abbey developed a love of the desert which would shape his life and art for the next forty years. After a brief military career, Abbey completed his education at the University of New Mexico and the University of Edinburgh. Abbey worked as a park ranger and fire lookout at several different National Parks throughout his life, experiences which provided material for his many works.

Il far bene l'amore, il saper sedurre, conquistare e poi trattenere a se la persona desiderata e per Ovidio un'arte vera e propria, al pari di quella oratoria o di quella militare. Autentico breviario della raffinatezza e della frivolezza di una societa gaudente e mondana, giunta ormai all'apice della sua potenza, i tre poemetti proposti nel volume sono un esempio di erotismo elegante, un repertorio di casistica amorosa, un catechismo del corteggiamento e dell'atto amatorio che, insegna Ovidio, con sapiente indugiare e repentino affrettarsi deve compiersi con la totale soddisfazione di entrambi i partner. Il genio di Ovidio si rivela in una serie vivacissima e colorata di scene maliziose e brillanti, inno a una giovinezza che sta fuggendo, tra teneri sussurri, grida e dolcezze.

In the words of Tamara herself:
""I wore anger like it was my favorite pair of Chucks, giving people what they wanted. A minstrel show played with black emotions rather than a shoe-polished face. This brings around an unspoken rule: The expectation of anger renders my anger invalid as it is my starting point, so it's not that important. This collection of poems takes a look at life, written over a fifteen year span of mine. It is flawed oddities, beauty foiled with ugliness. We are all more than just angry.

23473988,10,US,true,4.3,"Clive James is one of our finest critics and best-loved cultural voices. He is also a prize-winning poet. Since he was first enthralled by the mysterious power of poetry, he has been a dedicated student. In fact, for Clive, poetry has been nothing less than the occupation of a lifetime, and in this book he presents a distillation of all he's learned about the art form that matters to him most.
With his customary wit, delightfully lucid prose style and wide-ranging knowledge, Clive explains the difference between the innocuous stuff that often passes for poetry today and a real poem: the latter being a work of unity that insists on being heard entire and threatens never to leave the memory. A committed formalist and an astute commentator, Clive offers close and careful readings of individual poems and poets (from Shakespeare to Larkin, Keats to Pound), and in some case second readings or re-readings late in life - just to be sure he wasn't wrong the first time! Whether discussing technical details of metaphorical creativity or simply praising his five favourite collections of all time, he is never less than captivating.

11846944,8,US,true,4.01,"In She Walks in Beauty, Caroline Kennedy has once again marshaled the gifts of our greatest poets to pay a very personal tribute to the human experience, this time to the complex and fascinating subject of womanhood. Inspired by her own reflections on more than fifty years of life as a young girl, a woman, a wife, and a mother, She Walks in Beauty draws on poetry's eloquent wisdom to ponder the many joys and challenges of being a woman. Kennedy has divided the collection into sections that signify to her the most notable milestones, passages, and universal experiences in a woman's life, and she begins each of these sections with an introduction in which she explores and celebrates the most important elements of life's journey.
The collection includes works by Elizabeth Bishop, Sharon Olds, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mary Oliver, Pablo Neruda, W. H. Auden, Adrienne Rich, Sandra Cisneros, Anne Sexton, W. S. Merwin, Dorothy Parker, Queen Elizabeth I, Lucille Clifton, Naomi Shahib Nye, and W.
B. Yeats. Whether it's falling in love, breaking up, friendship, marriage, motherhood, or growing old, She Walks in Beauty is a priceless resource for anyone, male or female, who wants a deeper understanding and appreciation of what it means to be a woman.
She walks in beauty
George Gordon, Lord Byron
I She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellow'd to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
II One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
III And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11846944-she-walks-in-beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11846944-she-walks-in-beauty,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,73,13620480,She Walks in Beauty: A Woman's Journey Through Poems,She Walks in Beauty: A Woman's Journey Through Poems

Both beautifully written and deeply affecting, every poem is full of anger, sorrow, tenderness, and a palpable sense of grief. With graceful language and emotional acuity, Paul Monette captures the enormity of a loss that ravaged a generation. But even more than they are about tragedy, these poems are about love. Each moving line is full of love for one who is no longer there, but whose presence is still achingly felt at every turn. Love Aloneis remarkable for its honesty, its passion, and its depth.

12703631,1,US,true,4.18,"Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, philosopher and poet who wrote treatises on topics as diverse as mechanics, geography and music. His significance as a philosopher and teacher, and his few remaining philosophical works, have not received the same attention as his scientific and poetic writings. Zamakhshari referred to him as ""the philosopher of the world"". Many sources have testified that he taught for decades the philosophy of Ibn Sina in Nishapur where Khayyam was born and buried and where his mausoleum today remains a masterpiece of Iranian architecture visited by many people every year.
In the 17th century, Khayyam's work was translated into European languages, and he became the most famous poet of the East in the West with the Rubaiyat. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and of which there are about a thousand, attributed to Khayyam (1048-1131). A Persian ruba'i is a two-line stanza with two parts (or hemistechs) per line, hence the word ""Rubaiyat"" (derived from the Arabic root word for ""four""), meaning ""quatrains.""

19767755,2,US,true,3.55,"Author, activist, feminist, teacher, and artist bell hooks is celebrated as one of the nation's leading intellectuals. Born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, hooks drew her unique pseudonym from the name of her grandmother, an intelligent and strong-willed African American woman who inspired her to stand up against a dominating and repressive society. Her poetry, novels, memoirs, and children's books reflect her Appalachian upbringing and feature her struggles with racially integrated schools and unwelcome authority figures. One of Utne Reader's ""100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life,"" hooks has won wide acclaim from critics and readers alike. In Appalachian Elegy, bell hooks continues her work as an imagist of life's harsh realities in a collection of poems inspired by her childhood in the isolated hills and hidden hollows of Kentucky. At once meditative, confessional, and political, this poignant volume draws the reader deep into the experience of living in Appalachia. Touching on such topics as the marginalization of its people and the environmental degradation it has suffered over the years, hooks's poetry quietly elegizes the slow loss of an identity while also celebrating that which is constant, firmly rooted in a place that is no longer whole.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19767755-appalachian-elegy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19767755-appalachian-elegy,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,15,19427917,Appalachian Elegy: Poetry and Place,Appalachian Elegy: Poetry and Place

If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey through life.Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once the timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.

The multiplying shadows of the mind are made exterior here, surprisingly illustrated with anecdotal thought. And Dante no longer concludes that all lovers are martyrs. I'm so happy to have this work in my life."" -- Norman Dubie, author of The Volcano
""Anna Journey, in her new book of poems, Vulgar Remedies, creates an alchemical self whose shimmering limbic/alembic lyrics distill the mysterious terrors of childhood, the dangerous passions of adults, into her own honey-dusk 'voodun' protective, purified to gold. Poetry is always a time machine: here we are invisible travelers to a bewitched past, a beautifully occluded future.

Nao e para menos. Com pecas como ""Poema de sete faces"", ""Infancia"", ""No meio do caminho"", ""O sobrevivente"", entre tantos outros textos decisivos, o livro demonstra ja a enorme maturidade do jovem Drummond, ainda estabelecido em Belo Horizonte.
Dois anos antes, Drummond havia causado escandalo entre as hostes literarias ao publicar, na Revista de Antropofagia, o poema ""No meio do caminho"". Era o inicio da carreira de escandalo do poema, reconstruida na decada de 1960 pelo proprio autor em um livro que reuniria os ataques, as parodias e as contendas relacionadas ao poema.
Mas para alem da polemica, Alguma poesia ja apresenta aquilo de melhor que Carlos Drummond de Andrade iria oferecer ao longo de quase 60 anos de uma das carreiras mais fecundas da literatura moderna: o lirismo, o humor, o tom meditativo e ironico, a observacao desencantada dos fatos, o sensualismo, a reflexao aguda sobre o amor e a morte.
Contando com um posfacio do poeta e critico Eucanaa Ferraz, um dos grandes interpretes da obra drummondiana nos tempos atuais, esta edicao de Alguma poesia, com texto estabelecido e caderno de imagens, e uma nova - e extraordinaria - oportunidade para o leitor brasileiro entrar em contato com um de seus grandes autores.

Newly revised, with the Chinese originals and Red Pine's abundant commentary and notes, The Mountain Poems of Stonehouseis an essential volume for Zen students, readers of Asian literature, and all who love the outdoors.
After eating I dust off a boulder and sleep
and after sleeping I go for a walk
on a cloudy late summer day
an oriole sings from a sapling
briefly enjoying the season
joyfully singing out its heart
true happiness is right here
why chase an empty name
Stonehousewas born in 1272 in Changshu, China, and took his name from a cave at the edge of town. He became a highly respected dharma master in the Zen Buddhist tradition.
Red Pineis one of the world's leading translators of Chinese poetry. ""Every time I translate a book of poems,"" he writes, ""I learn a new way of dancing. And the music has to be Chinese.""

It follows the form of a ""revenge tragedy,"" in which the hero, Hamlet, seeks vengeance against his father's murderer, his uncle Claudius, now the king of Denmark.

Among them: What is the Ghost--Hamlet's father demanding justice, a tempting demon, an angelic messenger? Does Hamlet go mad, or merely pretend to? Once he is sure that Claudius is a murderer, why does he not act? Was his mother, Gertrude, unfaithful to her husband or complicit in his murder?

4943703,1,US,true,3.8,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

26232251,1,US,true,4.25,"Rainbows are a phenomenon caused by reflection, refraction, and the dispersion of light. They carry with them stories and myths, legends and beliefs, and when one appears in the sky after a storm, it's a reminder that something good, something gentle can come out of chaos.
But what if the chaos is the rainbow itself?
Burkhead gives readers a raw, gritty, and unapologetic realism in this collection. He shows them what happens when they take off their rose-colored glasses and look at the world around them. Instead of fields of freshly grown flowers, he writes of alleys with broken bottles and hypodermic needles, no happily-ever-afters, just blunt and honest truths, sometimes with endings, sometimes without. Just as life doesn't hand out answers, Burkhead doesn't sugarcoat its truths.
This collection is a reflection, an optical alteration on what readers pretend not to see: insecurities, pain, abuse, honesty. So often in life, and in poetry, the world is romanticized, as a playground where everyone falls in love, where everyone has their happy ending. But in the underside, there is heartbreak, there is isolation, there is repetition, just as there is addiction, sex, and repulsion. There are drunk days, too-sober nights, and in-betweens there is madness, there is confusion, there is clarity.
Not all rainbows are made of light.

While it's usually assumed in fairy tales that the princess is beloved by all, this is one princess who doesn't feel loved. She dreams of a moment when her father will walk through the castle door, sweep her up in his arms and proclaim how much he misses her. That never happens. Instead, she is introduced to a new step family. Just like in the fairy tales, this is where the story takes a dark twist; where addiction, abuse and adolescence thrive together in retched misery. From her lowest point as a hopeless fourteen-year-old girl who gives up all hope-- comes a spark of faith. This is where she begins her quest for a happy ending
Although the princess ends her very real fairy tale, D.L. Finn steps in and shares her thoughts, poetry and photographs.

Tsvetaeva's poetry was often of a very passionate and almost obsessive nature. She writes of unrequited love and heartbreak, of her admiration for other writers, of the devastation of war, and of her generally troubled life. Nonetheless, she is always able to contain this raw emotion in an extremely rigorous and disciplined form, unique only to her. Especially in her later poetry, frequent enjambments, inner rhymes, short lines, word play, and numerous allusions dominate her work.

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the Taleshas been translated into modern idiom. From the heroic romance of ""The Knight's Tale"" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant.

The long poem was the beginning of Cesaire's quest for negritude, and it became an anthem of Blacks around the world. With its emphasis on unusual juxtapositions of object and metaphor, manipulation of language into puns and neologisms, and rhythm, Cesaire considered his style a ""beneficial madness"" that could ""break into the forbidden"" and reach the powerful and overlooked aspects of black culture.
Clayton Eshleman and Annette Smith achieve a laudable adaptation of Cesaire's work to English by clarifying double meanings, stretching syntax, and finding equivalent English puns, all while remaining remarkably true to the French text. Their treatment of the poetry is marked with imagination, vigor, and accuracy that will clarify difficulties for those already familiar with French, and make the work accessible to those who are not. Andre Breton's introduction, A Great Black Poet, situates the text and provides a moving tribute to C saire.

Shadow Whisper
Behind the bleeding veils of coarse
Corrosive cords of linen stiffened
In the breath that freezes stars
And chokes the Moon in solitary
Nights, the blighted cries of voices
Moist with poisoned spells
Of Hell
Are drawn on charcoaled canvas cut
And torn by time
When echoes shadow sparks
In embers stifled under scars
Like drops of thought that thaw in thick
Black holes devouring dry, deserted
Worlds with wanton words of woes
And stares -
Behind the curtains no one cares.

With each successive book her drive to leave behind what came before has grown more fierce, the force of her gaze fixed on what has yet to be imagined. She invented a form to accommodate this need, the book-length sequence of poems, like a landscape seen from above, a novel with lacunae opening onto the unspeakable. The reiterated yet endlessly transfigured elements in this landscape--Persephone, a copper beech, a mother and father and sister, a garden, a husband and son, a horse, a dog, a field on fire, a mountain--persistently emerge and reappear with the dark energy of the inevitable, shot through with the bright aspect of things new-made.
From the outset (""Come here / Come here, little one""), Gluck's voice has addressed us with deceptive simplicity, the poems in lines so clear we ""do not see the intervening fathoms.""

From the 2007 British Poetry Society Popescu prize winner for European poetry in translation: a series of comic, surreal adventures. Kristiina Ehin's quirky voice takes each story directly from the dream state, at times stubborn and resistant, at other times masochistically compliant.

There is no one quite like Jack Gilbert in postwar American poetry. After garnering early acclaim with Views of Jeopardy(1962), he escaped to Europe and lived apart from the literary establishment, honing his uniquely fierce, declarative style, with its surprising abundance of feeling. He reappeared in our midst with Monolithos(1982) and then went underground again until The Great Fires(1994), which was eventually followed by Refusing Heaven(2005), a prizewinning volume of surpassing joy and sorrow, and the elegiac The Dance Most of All(2009). Whether his subject is his boyhood in working-class Pittsburgh, the women he has loved throughout his life, or the bittersweet losses we all face, Gilbert is by turns subtle and majestic: he steals up on the odd moment of grace; he rises to crescendos of emotion. At every turn, he illuminates the basic joys of everyday experience.

Vowing at an early age ""to be a poet or nothing at all,"" Hermann Hesse rebelled against formal education, focusing on a rigorous program of independent study that included literature, philosophy, art, and history. One result of these efforts was a series of novels that became counterculture bibles that remain widely influential today. Another was a body of evocative spiritual poetry. Published for the first time in English, these vivid, probing short works reflect deeply on the challenges of life and provide a spiritual solace that transcends specific denominational hymns, prayers, and rituals.
The Seasons of the Soul offers valuable guidance in poetic form for those longing for a more meaningful life, seeking a sense of homecoming in nature, in each stage of life, in a renewed relationship with the divine. Extensive quotations from his prose introduce each theme addressed in the book: love, imagination, nature, the divine, and the passage of time. A foreword by Andrew Harvey reintroduces us to a figure about whom some may have believed everything had already been said. Thoughtful commentary throughout from translator Ludwig Max Fischer helps readers understand the poems within the context of Hesse's life.

13530852,1,US,true,4.37,"An extraordinary literary event: Daniel Mendelsohn's acclaimed two-volume translation of the complete poems of C. P. Cavafy--including the first English translation of the poet's final Unfinished Poems--now published in one handsome edition and featuring the fullest literary commentaries available in English, by the renowned critic, scholar, and international best-selling author of The Lost.
No modern poet so vividly brought to life the history and culture of Mediterranean antiquity; no writer dared break, with such taut energy, the early-twentieth-century taboos surrounding homoerotic desire; no poet before or since has so gracefully melded elegy and irony as the Alexandrian Greek poet Constantine Cavafy (1863-1933). Whether advising Odysseus on his return to Ithaca or confronting the poet with the ghosts of his youth, these verses brilliantly make the historical personal--and vice versa. To his profound exploration of longing and loneliness, fate and loss, memory and identity, Cavafy brings the historian's assessing eye along with the poet's compassionate heart.
After more than a decade of work and study, Mendelsohn--a classicist who alone among Cavafy's translators shares the poet's deep intimacy with the ancient world--gives readers full access to the genius of Cavafy's verse: the sensuous rhymes, rich assonances, and strong rhythms of the original Greek that have eluded previous translators. Complete with the Unfinished Poems that Cavafy left in drafts when he died--a remarkable, hitherto unknown discovery that remained in the Cavafy Archive in Athens for decades--and with an in-depth introduction and a helpful commentary that situates each work in a rich historical, literary, and biographical context, this revelatory translation is a cause for celebration: the definitive presentation of Cavafy in English.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530852-complete-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530852-complete-poems,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340758527m/13530852.jpg,2,86912,Complete Poems,Complete Poems

In a display of solidarity with the victims and survivors of the Pulse nightclub shooting, a group of LGBTQ+ and straight allies, from all across the globe, came together to produce a collection of poems in celebration of love and acceptance.
The resulting Love is Love Poetry Anthology is dedicated to the families and victims of the shooting and all proceeds of this work will be donated to Equality Florida's Pulse Victims Fund.

11916315,3,US,true,4.24,"Vowing at an early age ""to be a poet or nothing at all,"" Hermann Hesse rebelled against formal education, focusing on a rigorous program of independent study that included literature, philosophy, art, and history. One result of these efforts was a series of novels that became counterculture bibles that remain widely influential today. Another was a body of evocative spiritual poetry. Published for the first time in English, these vivid, probing short works reflect deeply on the challenges of life and provide a spiritual solace that transcends specific denominational hymns, prayers, and rituals.
The Seasons of the Soul offers valuable guidance in poetic form for those longing for a more meaningful life, seeking a sense of homecoming in nature, in each stage of life, in a renewed relationship with the divine. Extensive quotations from his prose introduce each theme addressed in the book: love, imagination, nature, the divine, and the passage of time. A foreword by Andrew Harvey reintroduces us to a figure about whom some may have believed everything had already been said. Thoughtful commentary throughout from translator Ludwig Max Fischer helps readers understand the poems within the context of Hesse's life.

Kate Tempest's words in Brand New Ancients are written to be read aloud; the book combines poem, rap, and humanist sermon, by turns tender and fierce. Set in Southeast London, Brand New Ancients finds the mythic in the mundane. It is the story of two half-brothers, Thomas and Clive, unknown to each other -- Thomas the result of an affair between his mother and Clive's father. Tempest, with wide-ranging empathy, takes us inside the passionless marriage of Jane and Kevin -- the man who suspects Thomas is not his son, but loves him just the same -- and the neighboring home of Mary and Brian, where betrayal has not been so placidly accepted. The sons of these two households -- quiet, creative Thomas and angry, destructive Clive -- will cross paths in adolescence, their fates converging with mortal fury.
These characters' loves, their infidelities, their disappointments and their small comforts -- these, Tempest argues, are timeless. Our lives and our choices are no less important than those of history and myth. Awarded the Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry, Brand New Ancientsinsists on our importance as individuals -- and asserts Kate Tempest's importance as a talent impossible to ignore.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25172139-brand-new-ancients,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25172139-brand-new-ancients,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,18,26023486,Brand New Ancients,Brand New Ancients

I fiumi e una poesia dell' Allegria lunga; di solito, a quei tempi, ero breve, spesso brevissimo, laconico: alcuni vocaboli deposti nel silenzio come un lampo nella notte, un gruppo fulmineo d'immagini, mi bastavano a evocare il paesaggio sorgente d'improvviso ad incontrarne tanti altri nella memoria. Notte di maggio , Fase d'Oriente , Tramonto , Fase , Silenzio : ecco alcune poesie dove, nell'attesa della guerra, in ""Lacerba"", era da me sorpreso il famigliare miraggio d'Alessandria. Alessandria all'orizzonte cancellata, Alessandria per sempre persa e per sempre ritrovata per via di poesia. S'ingannerebbe chi prendesse il mio tono nostalgico, frequente in quei miei primi tentativi, come il mio tono fondamentale. Non sono il poeta dell'abbandono alle delizie del sentimento, sono uno abituato a lottare, e devo confessarlo - gli anni vi hanno portato qualche rimedio - sono un violento: sdegno e coraggio di vivere sono stati la traccia della mia vita. Volonta di vivere nonostante tutto, stringendo i pugni, nonostante il tempo, nonostante la morte. Potrei cosi commentare Agonia , Pellegrinaggio , quelle poesie del primo momento, di ""Lacerba"", o quelle gia del Porto Sepolto, dove mi scopro e mi identifico, dentro gli orrori della guerra, nell'uomo di pena e, come tale, Ungaretti, uomo di pena , mi parra di dovermi anche in seguito, sempre, identificare.

The title sets the tone for poems about backgrounds and outlines and shadows and sources of light. This extraordinary book -- ""a wide lotus on the dark waters of song"" -- is filled with surprises at every turn, as a Moorish mosque becomes a cathedral in Seville, a country girl dresses in Sunday clothes to visit a Jamaican bookmobile, and a bear appears suddenly, only to slip away silently into the trees on a road in British Columbia. The heartache of Billy Holliday singing the blues, the burden of Charlie Chaplin tramping the banana walks of Jamaica's Golden Cloud, and the paintings of El Greco, the quintessential stranger, come together on the poet's pilgrimage to Heartease, guided by a limping angel and inspired by the passage-making of Dante; the book ends with a superb version of the first of his cantos, translated into the poet's Jamaican language and landscape with the gift of love.

Though her extant work consists only of a collection of fragments and a handful of complete poems, her mystique endures to be discovered anew by each generation, and to inspire new efforts at bringing the spirit of her Greek words faithfully into English.
In the past, translators have taken two basic approaches to Sappho: either very literally translating only the words in the fragments, or taking the liberty of reconstructing the missing parts. Willis Barnstone has taken a middle course, in which he remains faithful to the words of the fragments, only very judiciously filling in a word or phrase in cases where the meaning is obvious.

She is constantly inspired by nature and she invites you to share with her the thrill of a new spring, mercurial summer, the glorious colours of autumn, the frozen wonders of winter.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25841655-encounter,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25841655-encounter,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435914515m/25841655.jpg,6,44332230,Encounter,Encounter

18964931,1,US,true,4.17,"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was an American poet. He wrote the first American translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets. He established his literary career by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems. About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that an influential trustee, Benjamin Orr, had been so impressed Longfellow's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish and Italian. When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He began publishing his poetry, including Voices of the Night in 1839 and Ballads and Other Poems, which included his famous poem The Village Blacksmith, in 1841.

Jennifer Kronovet's poetry is inflected by her fraught, ecstatic relationship with language--sentences, words, phonemes, punctuation--and how meaning is both gained and lost in the process of communicating. Having lived all over the world, both using her native tongue and finding it impossible to use, Kronovet approaches poems as tactile, foreign objects, as well as intimate, close utterances.
In The Wug Test,named for a method by which a linguist discovered how deeply imprinted the cognitive instinct toward acquiring language is in children, Kronovet questions whether words are objects we should escape from or embrace. Dispatches of text from that researcher, Walt Whitman, Ferdinand de Saussure, and the poet herself, among other voices, are mined for their futility as well as their beauty, in poems that are technically revealing and purely pleasurable. Throughout, a boy learns how to name and ask for those things that makes up his world.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28959403-the-wug-test,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28959403-the-wug-test,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458496528m/28959403.jpg,23,49186177,The Wug Test: Poems,The Wug Test: Poems

Dotheadis an exploration of selfhood both intense and exhilarating.

From poems about the treatment at the airport of people who look like Majmudar (""my dark unshaven brothers / whose names overlap with the crazies and God fiends"") to a long, freewheeling abecedarian poem about Adam and Eve and the discovery of oral sex, Dotheadis a profoundly satisfying cultural critique and a thrilling experiment in language.

During the first millenium of our era, speakers of Uralic languages (those outside the Indo-European group) who had settled in the Baltic region of Karelia, that straddles the border of eastern Finland and north-west Russia, developed an oral poetry that was to last into the nineteenth century. This poetry provided the basis of the Kalevala. It was assembled in the 1840s by the Finnish scholar Elias Lonnrot, who took `dictation' from the performance of a folk singer, in much the same way as our great collections from the past, from Homeric poems to medieval songs and epics, have probably been set down.

The second part of the book is a powerful sequence of elegies for his twin brother, Peter, and the dominant mood elsewhere is elegiac. The title poem begins: 'I have been thinking about the music for my funeral ...' The two parts are also linked by Homer. Longley is well-known for his Homeric versions, and the Iliad is a presiding presence - both in poems about the Great War and in the range of imagery that gives his twin's death a mythic dimension. Yet funeral music can be life-affirming. Longley has built this collection on intricate doublings, not only when he explores the tensions of twinship. The psychologically suggestive word 'stairwell' is itself an ambiguous compound. These poems encompass birth as well as death, childhood and age, nature and art, the animal and human worlds, tenderness and violence, battlefield and 'homeland'. The Stairwellis a richly textured, immensely moving work.

""In this collection, Purmasir sheds her skin so wholly and so truly that you forget her fingers are the ones holding the pen. Purmasir steps away from herself and into her dead father to look back at the world she has existed in without him. She peers into the shadowy corners of her own life and, through her father's eyes, floods them with light. If this seems sad, be sure that isn't the only thing it is. It's also funny and beautiful and so devastatingly human that you almost want to look away. You almost aren't used to such unwavering honesty.

It is at times referred to as the ""manual for mankind"" and has been highly praised by not only prominent Indians such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi but also Aldous Huxley, Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Jung and Herman Hesse. It is considered among the most important texts in the history of literature and philosophy. The Bhagavad Gita comprises exactly 700 verses, and is a part of the Mahabharata. The teacher of the Bhagavad Gita is Lord Krishna, who is revered by Hindus as a manifestation of God (Parabrahman) itself, and is referred to within as Bhagavan, the Divine One.
The content of the Gita is the conversation between Lord Krishna and the Pandava Prince Arjuna taking place on the battlefield before the start of the Kurukshetra War. Responding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma about fighting his own cousins, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince, and elaborates on different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies, with examples and analogies. This has led to the Gita often being described as a concise guide to Hindu theology and also as a practical, self-contained guide to life. - from Wikipedia",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10508037-the-bhagavad-gita,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10508037-the-bhagavad-gita,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,87,1492580,The Bhagavad-Gita,The Bhagavad-Gita

. . . Reality has put itself so solidly before me
there's little need for mystery . . . Except for us, for how we take the world
to us, and make it more, more than we are, more even than itself.
--from ""The World""
In his first volume since Repair, C. K. Williams treats the characteristic subjects of a poet's maturity--the loss of friends, the love of grandchildren, the receding memories of childhood, the baffling illogic of current events--with an intensity and drive that recall not only his recent work but also his early books, published forty years ago. He gazes at a Rembrandt self-portrait, and from it fashions a self-portrait of his own. He ponders an ""anatomical effigy"" at the Museum of Mankind, an in so doing ""dissects"" our common humanity. Stoking a fire at a house in the country, he recalls a friend who was burned horribly in war, and then turns, with eloquence and authority, to contemporary life during wartime, asking ""how those with power over us can effect these things, by what cynical reasoning do they pardon themselves.""

Ten years since Canada opened its embassy in Kabul and launched Operation ATHENA to establish security in the city. Twelve years since Canadian forces were committed to Operation Enduring Freedom to dismantle al-Qaeda's network and remove the Taliban from power. As Canada prepares to bring its troops home for good, Masham Means Evening is a poetry collection that takes the reader inside army camps, convoys, schools, markets, and villages, charting a young female soldier's tour through Canada's war in Afghanistan.

Sensual lyricism contrasts with clean, spare language, bringing us quietly to the tragedies and small celebrations that happen in the spaces between.

25602621,1,US,true,4.2,"Love is an exorcism of angels...
Heaven and Hell are not places, nor times, but rather shared experiences. It's a love whether dark or light, a passion whether of pleasure or pain, and there's a beauty to the ugliness, a smile hidden amongst the tears. Heaven is often defined as paradise; Hell as damnation. The two, while opposites, more often than not, end up being one in the same, especially when it comes to falling in love.
So what happens when our Heaven falls in love with our Hell? When the very person who brings us every happiness and every joy, stabs and beats at our hearts, bruising our fantasy of 'happily ever after,' of 'till death do us part?' What happens when we can't walk away because the pain of love is better than no love at all? When we'd rather die every death again and again, than spend one moment away from our heart's true content? Wytovich plays Virgil in a collection of celestial horror that challenges the definition of angels and demons, of love and hate. She weaves through tales of heartbreak and sorrow, through poems depicting lust and greed, as her words prove testament that Heaven and Hell can be one in the same, a paradise and an inferno. Her women, some innocent, some not, walk through the circles, fall off of clouds, deny their wings, and expose their hearts to demons and devils, to imps and to fiends. They turn their backs on everything they know, question their morals and their faith, all in the name of love, and together, the good help the bad, and the bad, help the good, as not every angel has wings just as not every demon has claws.
Wytovich shows us that love isn't always the saving grace that we expect it to be. To her, there is no balance of darkness to light, no line between what one desires and what one gets. There's no choosing who we fall in love with, and just as love is often Heaven, it can just as easily be Hell.

What Are They Saying About An Exorcism of Angels
""Fall into a world where the angels themselves love, but the demonic will love you with more teeth. These are beautifully twisted poems of madness, and the title poem itself had faint traces of Poe's 'Annabel Lee.' This collection is certainly worth tasting and then savoring."" -Mercedes M. Yardley, author of Pretty Little Dead Girls
""Stephanie M. Wytovich lays bare the darkest yearnings of the human--and inhuman--heart with scalpel-like precision. These are poems forged in hellfire and cooled by a dead lover's kiss."" -Tim Waggoner, author of The Way of All Flesh and Eat the Night",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25602621-an-exorcism-of-angels,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25602621-an-exorcism-of-angels,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433199522m/25602621.jpg,4,45386109,An Exorcism of Angels,An Exorcism of Angels

Like the present book's title, Collins's poems are filled with mischief, humor, and irony, ""Poetry speaks to all people, it is said, but here I would like to address / only those in my own time zone""-but also with quiet observation, intense wonder, and a reverence for the everyday: ""The birds are in their trees, / the toast is in the toaster, / and the poets are at their windows. / They are at their windows in every section of the tangerine of earth-the Chinese poets looking up at the moon, / the American poets gazing out / at the pink and blue ribbons of sunrise.""
Through simple language, Collins shows that good poetry doesn't have to be obscure or incomprehensible, qualities that are perhaps the real trouble with most ""serious"" poetry: ""By now, it should go without saying / that what the oven is to the baker / and the berry-stained blouse to the drycleaner / so the window is to the poet.""
In this dazzling new collection, his first in three years, Collins explores boyhood, jazz, love, the passage of time, and, of course, writing-themes familiar to Collins's fans but made new here. Gorgeous, funny, and deeply empathetic, Billy Collins's poetry is a window through which we see our lives as if for the first time.

'This is the last of you, old world - soon we'll smash you to bits.'
The passionate voices of radicals, dreamers, workers, aristocrats, satirists and romantics fill these electrifying poems and prose pieces, written between 1917 and 1919 in the full tumult of the Russian Revolution.
From apocalyptic visions to heartfelt calls for freedom, from depictions of bloody carnage to an acerbic portrait of Lenin, the writings brought together here are by turns fervent, absurd, disorienting and tragic.
Some writers - Bulgakov, Pasternak, Mayakovsky, Akhmatova - are well-known, others all but forgotten; many would not survive what was to come. All speak to us a century later, re-creating the whirlwind of euphoria and terror, hopes and betrayals of that exhilarating, brutal time.

Poetry is never more vital, meaningful, or accessible than in the hands of David Orr. In the pieces collected here, most of them written originally for the New York Times, Orr is at his rigorous, conversational, and edifying best. Whether he is considering the careers of contemporary masters, such as Louise Gluckor Frederick Seidel, sizing up younger American poets, like Matthea Harvey and Matthew Zapruder, or even turning his attention to celebrities and public figures, namely Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Fry, when they choose to wade into the hotly contested waters of the poetry world, Orr is never any less than fully persuasive in arguing what makes a poem or poet great or not. After all, as Orr points out in his introduction, Poetry is a lot like America, in the sense that liking all of it means that you probably shouldn't be trusted with money, or scissors.
Orr's prose is devoted to common sense and clarity, and, in every case, he brings to bear an impeccable ear, an openhandedness of spirit, and a deep wealth of technical knowledge to say nothing of his shrewd sense of humor. As pleasurable as it is informative, Orr's journalism represents a high watermark in the public discussion of literature.

In this much-anticipated second book, Richard Siken seeks definite answers to indefinite questions: what it means to be called to make--whether it is a self, love, war, or art--and what it means to answer that call. In poems equal parts contradiction and clarity, logic and dream, Siken tells the modern world an unforgettable fable about itself.
The Museum
Two lovers went to the museum and wandered the rooms.
He saw a painting and stood in front of it
for too long. It was a few minutes before she
realized he had gotten stuck. He was stuck looking
at a painting. She stood next to him, looking at his
face and then the face in the painting. What do you
see? she asked. I don't know, he said. He didn't
know. She was disappointed, then bored. He was
looking at a face and she was looking at her watch.
This is where everything changed . . .

The influence and popularity of Rilke's poetry in America have never been greater than they are today, more than fifty years after his death. Rilke is unquestionably the most significant and compelling poet of romantic transformation, of spiritual quest, that the twentieth century has known. His poems of ecstatic identification with the world exert a seemingly endless fascination for contemporary readers.
In Stephen Mitchell's versions, many readers feel that they have discovered an English rendering that captures the lyric intensity, fluency, and reach of Rilke's poetry more accurately and convincingly than has ever been done before.
Mr. Mitchell is impeccable in his adherence to Rilke's text, to his formal music, and to the complexity of his thought; at the same time, his work has authority and power as poetry in its own right. Few translators of any poet have arrived at the delicate balance of fidelity and originality that Mr. Mitchell has brought off with seeming effortlessness.

Rimaste ignote fino alla sua morte, le poesie di Emily Dickinson, enigmatiche, sfuggenti, tormentate, esercitano da piu di un secolo un fascino straordinario sui lettori e sulla critica che in vario modo le ha apprezzate ed esaltate, ritenendole l'espressione di un'esperienza umana di profondissima intensita, di un'esistenza lacerante, di una sensibilita altissima, quasi estrema, di una solitudine scelta e cantata senza alcun compiacimento, con un linguaggio decisamente allusivo, talvolta frammentato, costantemente teso alla conquista di una dimensione spirituale universale e assoluta.

Her fist book, Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns opened the door to Gibson's unapologetic voice, yet TITLE manages to take an even more intimate look at the subjects of family, war, spirituality, gender, grief and hope. The poems' topics range from hate crimes to playgrounds, from international conflict to hometowns, from falling in love to the desperation of loneliness. Gibson's work seizes us by the collar and hauls us inside some of her darkest moments, then releases out the other side. Moments later, we find ourselves inhaling words that fill us with light. Her luminous imagery is a buoy that allows us to resurface from her world clutching new possibilities of our own. Throughout her career, Gibson's poems have always been a call tosocial justice. But this collection goes beyond awareness. Her images linger in our psyches and entreat us to action. They challenge us to grow into our own skin. The journey may be raw at times but we are continuously left inspired, held, and certain we are not alone.

Anne, Charlotte e Emily Bronte, le sorelle piu famose della letteratura mondiale, vissero le loro travagliate e brevi vite durante la prima meta del XIX secolo nella campagna inglese, nella regione dello Yorkshire. Figlie di un parroco anglicano di origini irlandesi, educate secondo i rigidi dettami dell'epoca, coltivarono fin da giovanissime una straordinaria passione per la letteratura e la poesia. Temendo i pregiudizi riguardo alle donne scrittrici scelsero, per pubblicare le loro opere, gli pseudonimi maschili di Acton, Currer, Ellis Bell, rispettando le iniziali del nome e cognome di ciascuna di loro. Dopo essersi dedicate, senza grandi fortune, alla pubblicazione di una raccolta di poesie, nel 1847 pubblicarono, in contemporanea, i tre romanzi Jane Eyre, Agnes Greye Cime tempestose. L'opera di Charlotte,Jane Eyre, un romanzo di formazione scritto in forma di autobiografia, fu accolto con notevole favore e anche Agnes Greydella sorella Anne ricevette numerose lodi, ma il pubblico e la critica dell'epoca vittoriana rivelarono scarsa lungimiranza nel decretare l'insuccesso di Cime tempestose, unico romanzo di Emily Bronte, ormai considerato un capolavoro della letteratura mondiale. Questo volume comprende l'opera narrativa completa delle tre sorelle Bronte.
Anne Bronte
(Thornton 1820 - Scarborough 1849), sorella minore di Charlotte ed Emily, visse fino a diciannove anni nella campagna inglese dello Yorkshire, insieme al padre, un umile pastore di origini irlandesi, e al resto della famiglia. Impiegatasi poi come governante, lascio presto la professione per coltivare le proprie ambizioni letterarie, che furono tuttavia stroncate dalla tubercolosi, malattia che porto Anne a una morte precoce nel 1849. Fece in tempo, pero, a scrivere i due romanziLa signora di Wildfell Hall, Agnes Grey(entrambi presenti in questo volume) oltre a un libro di poesie, scritte insieme alle sorelle.
Charlotte Bronte 
(Thornton 1816 - Haworth 1855) trascorse nello Yorkshire la propria vita funestata da malattie e disgrazie familiari. Fu autrice di romanzi che hanno per protagoniste delle drammatiche figure di donne: Villette, Jane Eyre, Shirley e Il professore, tutti presenti nel volume Tutti i romanzi.
Emily Bronte
(Thornton, 1818 - Haworth, 1848) crebbe nella selvaggia e desolata brughiera dello Yorkshire e, con le sorelle Charlotte e Anne, condusse fin dall'infanzia un'esistenza chiusa in un'aspra solitudine e segnata da una fortissima tensione interiore.

3231163,1,US,true,3.8,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

Para muchos, Ruben Dario es el padre del modernismo. Los poetas parnasianos y simbolistas franceses ejercieron una gran influencia en su obra, pero a partir de Prosas profanas(1896 y 1901) su estilo, perfilado en Azul (1888, revisado en 1890 y celebrado como el primer poemario modernista), se define para llegar a Cantos de vida y esperanza(1905), considerado el mejor ejemplo de su poesia. Aqui el poeta vuelve a sus temas recurrentes para afirmar que el arte siempre superara a la naturaleza, pues es el unico elemento capaz de restablecer la armonia divina.
Esta edicion incluye una introduccion que contextualiza la obra, un aparato de notas, una cronologia y una bibliografia esencial, asi como tambien varias propuestas de discusion y debate en torno a la lectura.

George Washington Carver was born a slave in Missouri about 1864 and raised by the childless white couple who had owned his mother. In 1877 he left home in search of an education, eventually earning a master's degree. In 1896 Booker T. Washington invited Carver to start the agricultural department at the all-black-staffed Tuskegee Institute, where he spent the rest of his life seeking solutions to the poverty among landless black farmers by developing new uses for soil-replenishing crops such as peanuts, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes. Carver's achievements as a botanist and inventor were balanced by his gifts as a painter, musician, and teacher.

""What would you say to your ex, without judgment?""
This is the question filmmaker and vlogger Will Darbyshire posed to hundreds of thousands of his closest friends on YouTube. Seeking closure after a tough break-up, Will was driven to strike up an intimate conversation with his online audience, and to get at the heart of one of life's unknowable yet universal mysteries: love.
Over a period of six months, Will posed a series of questions to his audience and asked them to reveal their innermost feelings about their own romantic experiences in the form of hand-written letters, poems, photographs, and emails.
The result is a curated collection of responses that are, at turns, funny, dark, confessional, awkward, comforting, and uplifting.

10926905,1,US,true,4.11,"Catullus, who lived during some of the most interesting and tumultuous years of the late Roman Republic, spent his short but intense life (?84-54 B.C.E.) in high Roman society, rubbing shoulders with various cultural and political luminaries, including Caesar, Cicero, and Pompey. Catullus's poetry is by turns ribald, lyric, romantic, satirical; sometimes obscene and always intelligent, it offers us vivid pictures of the poet's friends, enemies, and lovers. The verses to his friends are bitchy, funny, and affectionate; those to his enemies are often wonderfully nasty. Many poems brilliantly evoke his passionate affair with Lesbia, often identified as Clodia Metelli, a femme fatale ten years his senior and the smart, adulterous wife of an arrogant aristocrat. Cicero later claimed she poisoned her husband.
This new bilingual translation of Catullus's surviving poems by Peter Green is fresh, bawdy, and utterly engaging. Unlike its predecessors, it adheres to the principle that the rhythm of a poem, whether familiar or not, is among the most crucial elements for its full appreciation. Green provides an essay on the poet's life and literary background, a historical sketch of the politically fraught late Roman Republic in which Catullus lived, copious notes on the poems, a wide-ranging bibliography for further reading, and a full glossary.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10926905-the-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10926905-the-poems,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,5,86110,The Poems,The Poems

25915161,2,US,true,3.17,"A bawdy and boisterous poem of Ireland, translated by one of its most distinguished literary sons
As a teacher and translator of Irish verse, Frank O'Connor brought to the world's attention many fine poems from his native land, few as enduring--and none as controversial--as Brian Merriman's The Midnight Court.
An eighteenth-century masterpiece widely recognized as the greatest comic poem in Irish literature, The Midnight Court is a hilarious and insightful take on the battle of the sexes. In the court of a fairy queen, the men and women of Ireland air their grievances with one another. The competing lists of complaints are as long as they are uproarious, and when the queen rules in favor of the women, all young Irish bachelors are doomed to a terrible fate: marriage.
The Midnight Court has now taken its rightful place in the Irish literary canon, but when O'Connor's English translation was first published in 1945, the Irish government banned it as obscene. In a delicious irony that might have been lifted from one of O'Connor's short stories, the Gaelic original met with no censure. Here, as it first appeared, is Frank O'Connor's faithful, funny, and eloquent translation of one of the most important works in Irish literature.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25915161-the-midnight-court-and-other-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25915161-the-midnight-court-and-other-poems,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,4,42361163,The Midnight Court and Other Poems,The Midnight Court and Other Poems

It appeared, to great critical praise, for sale only in Oklahoma bookstores more than fifty years ago. Since then it has become the most sought-after L'Amour title of all, with the few circulating copies from the small print run commanding top dollar from rare book collectors. Now, at last, it is being published nationally in this beautiful keepsake Bantam edition.
It was in Smoke From This Altarthat L'Amour first gave public voice to his now-celebrated spirit of wanderlust. Like the short stories in his classic, million-copy-selling Yondering, and his best-selling memoir Education of a Wandering Man, the poems in this book are inspired by his experiences and memories of his journeys across oceans and continents. It is vintage L'Amour storytelling--in verse--about nature, the land, and the people who loved and braved it.
Smoke From This Altarbegins with a newly written introduction by his wife Kathy in which she discusses the special place this work has held in the L'Amours' lives. In concludes with twenty previously uncollected L'Amour poems selected by his family.
Impassioned, adventurous, heroic, and humorous, Smoke From This Altaris unique L'Amour writing, to be read and enjoyed again and again.

At the core of How Snow Fallsare four long poems that explore the possibilities of the form; there are two ardent elegies, one for the poet's mother and one for a dead lover; a sparkling reworking of Ryunosuke Akutagawa's story In a Grove; lastly a ""film-poem,"" High Table. These poems are sometimes joyous, often moving, and always turn an unflinching gaze on the world.

To evade contemporary prejudice against female writers, the Bronte sisters adopted androgynous first names. All three retained the first letter of their first names: Charlotte became Currer Bell, Anne became Acton Bell, and Emily became Ellis Bell. The book was printed by Aylott and Jones, from London. The first edition failed to attract interest, with only two copies being sold. However, the sisters decided to continue writing for publication and began work on their first novels, which became commercial successes. Following the success of Charlotte's Jane Eyre in 1848, and after the deaths of Emily and Anne, the second edition of this book (printed in 1850 by Smith & Elder) fared much better, with Charlotte's additions of previously unpublished poetry by her two late sisters.

Despite of this, one can't help but like and feel sorry for Peer, as it is easy to recognize something of yourself in him.
Peer Gynt is the most well known Norwegian play throughout history and is based loosely on the folklore about Per Gynt. It is a dramatic poem in five acts, and has been aptly described as the story of a life based on procrastination and avoidance.

Unfortunately, Wilde's personality was too colorful for the conservative morals of upper-class British society. In 1895, after he was accused of ""unnatural acts"" by the father of one his lovers, the writer was prosecuted and sentenced to 2 years' hard labor -- the maximum possible. The prison term broke both the writer's health and his spirit.
This edition also includes a foreword and editor's notes about the works.

But unlike his two renowned colleagues, Ryokan was a societal dropout, living mostly as a hermit and a beggar. He was never head of a monastery or temple. He liked playing with children. He had no dharma heir. Even so, people recognized the depth of his realization, and he was sought out by people of all walks of life for the teaching to be experienced in just being around him. His poetry and art were wildly popular even in his lifetime. He is now regarded as one of the greatest poets of the Edo Period, along with Basho, Buson, and Issa. He was also a master artist-calligrapher with a very distinctive style, due mostly to his unique and irrepressible spirit, but also because he was so poor he didn't usually have materials: his distinctive thin line was due to the fact that he often used twigs rather than the brushes he couldn't afford. He was said to practice his brushwork with his fingers in the air when he didn't have any paper. There are hilarious stories about how people tried to trick him into doing art for them, and about how he frustrated their attempts. As an old man, he fell in love with a young Zen nun who also became his student. His affection for her colors the mature poems of his late period.

The definitive collection of Emerson's major speeches, essays, and poetry, The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emersonchronicles the life's work of a true ""American Scholar."" As one of the architects of the transcendentalist movement, Emerson embraced a philosophy that championed the individual, emphasized independent thought, and prized ""the splendid labyrinth of one's own perceptions."" More than any writer of his time, he forged a style distinct from his European predecessors and embodied and defined what it meant to be an American. Matthew Arnold called Emerson's essays ""the most important work done in prose.""

They stand before the Venus de Milo as well as the moon, as they measure distances between what we make as art and who we are as humans.

Fue el primer libro publicado por Vallejo y en el evidencia su evolucion desde un modernismo decadentista, hasta la creacion de una poetica sumamente personal. Los heraldos negros es tambien el titulo del poema liminar o que sirve de introduccion al libro.
Los heraldos negros fue impreso en los talleres de la Penitenciaria de Lima. La obra debio aparecer en 1918 tal como esta fechada en su portada, pero la demora se debio a que Vallejo espero vanamente el prologo que le habia prometido escribir su amigo Abraham Valdelomar, quien por alguna razon no pudo cumplir. La obra circulo recien en julio de 1919, en corto tiraje.
En algun momento se dijo que el poemario fue recibido con indiferencia o desden por la elite intelectual peruana, en especial por la limena. Lo cual es falso, tal como lo demostro Alcides Spelucin al exhumar los elogios que entonces recibio de parte de Manuel Gonzalez Prada, Jose Maria Eguren, Abraham Valdelomar, Juan Parra del Riego, Antenor Orrego, Luis Gongora y Ezequiel Balarezo Pinillos. En general los criticos resaltaron su tono renovador pues aunque todavia se hallaba bajo el influjo modernista, ya poseia una nueva sensibilidad y una poderosa originalidad que anunciaban a un gran poeta.
Hay que senalar que son pocos los poemas de este libro que datan de 1915 y 1916; la mayoria fueron escritos en el periodo de 1917-1918. Algunos de ellos aparecieron previamente en periodicos y revistas de Trujillo y Lima, por ejemplo, el notable poema ""Ausente"", que aparecio en la revista Mundo Limeno, a mediados de 1917.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26161507-los-heraldos-negros,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26161507-los-heraldos-negros,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,7,161652,Los heraldos negros,Los heraldos negros

Grown men aren&#8217;t supposed to cry&#8230;Yet in this fascinating anthology, one hundred men&#8212;distinguished in literature and film, science and architecture, theater and human rights&#8212;confess to being moved to tears by poems that continue to haunt them. Although the majority are public figures not prone to crying, here they admit to breaking down, often in words as powerful as the poems themselves.
Their selections include classics by visionaries, such as Walt Whitman, W.H. Auden, and Philip Larkin, as well as modern works by masters, including Billy Collins, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, and poets who span the globe from Pablo Neruda to Rabindranath Tagore. The poems chosen range from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, with more than a dozen by women, including Mary Oliver, Elizabeth Bishop, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Their themes range from love in its many guises, through mortality and loss, to the beauty and variety of nature. All are moved to tears by the exquisite way a poet captures, in Alexander Pope&#8217;s famous phrase, &#8220;what oft was thought, but ne&#8217;er so well express&#8217;d.&#8221;

Its publication put Sebald in the company of Nabokov, Calvino, and Borges. Yet Sebald's brilliance as a poet has been largely unacknowledged--until now.
Skillfully translated by Iain Galbraith, the nearly one hundred poems in Across the Land and the Waterrange from those Sebald wrote as a student in the sixties to those completed right before his untimely death in 2001. Featuring eighty-eight poems published in English for the first time and thirty-three from unpublished manuscripts, this collection also brings together all the verse he placed in books and journals during his lifetime.
Here are Sebald's trademark themes--from nature and history (""Events of war within/a life cracks/across the Order of the World/spreading from Cassiopeia/a diffuse pain reaching into/the upturned leaves on the trees""), to wandering and wondering (""I have even begun/to speak in foreign tongues/roaming like a nomad in my own/town . . .""), to oblivion and memory (""If you knew every cranny/of my heart/you would yet be ignorant/of the pain my happy/memories bring"").

The untimely death of my father was the inspiration for more than one of these poems, and a significant anniversary is coming up. Sometimes funerals seem to come in flocks, with a new loss every few weeks. Sometimes a chance remark will bring back an image, a laugh, a ghost. I have captured some of that in this volume.
You will find cinquains, mirrors, rhymed stanzas, a rondeau, one prose poem, and blank verse. You will find deliberate ambiguity and harsh accuracy. Some poems are easily accessible, and others may benefit from a second reading. Some are literal and some figurative.

Robert Hass--former poet laureate, winner of the National Book Award, and recipient of the Pulitzer Prize--illuminates the formal impulses that underlie great poetry in this sophisticated, graceful, and accessible volume of essays drawn from a series of lectures he delivered at the renowned Iowa Writers' Workshop.
A Little Book on Form brilliantly synthesizes Hass's formidable gifts as both a poet and a critic and reflects his profound education in the art of poetry. Starting with the exploration of a single line as the basic gesture of a poem, and moving into an examination of the essential expressive gestures that exist inside forms, Hass goes beyond approaching form as a set of traditional rules that precede composition, and instead offers penetrating insight into the true openness and instinctiveness of formal creation.
A Little Book on Form is a rousing reexamination of our longest lasting mode of literature from one of our greatest living poets.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20868980-a-little-book-on-form,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20868980-a-little-book-on-form,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392769517m/20868980.jpg,15,40206958,A Little Book on Form: An Exploration Into the Formal Imagination of Poetry,A Little Book on Form: An Exploration Into the Formal Imagination of Poetry

Holderlin's sole novel has been celebrated for its musicality, the power of its cadences and tones to express a constant oscillation between extremes of grief and joy.

But to the chagrin of many admirers, Moore eliminated a third of its contents from her subsequent poetry collections while radically revising some of the poems she retained. This groundbreaking book has been unavailable to the general reader since its original publication in the 1920s.
Presented with a new introduction by Linda Leavell, the author of the award-winning biography Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore, this reissue of Observations at last allows readers to experience the untamed force of Moore's most dazzling innovations. Her fellow modernists were thrilled by her originality, her ""clear, flawless"" language--to them she was ""a rafter holding up . . . our uncompleted building."" Equally forceful for subsequent generations, Observationswas an ""eye-opener"" to the young Elizabeth Bishop, its poems ""miracles of language and construction."" John Ashbery has called ""An Octopus"" the finest poem of ""our greatest modern poet."" Moore's heroic open-mindedness and prescient views on multiculturalism, biodiversity, and individual liberty make her work uniquely suited to our times.

The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Persian: rb`yt `mr khym) is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer. A ruba'i is a two-line stanza with two parts (or hemistichs) per line, hence the word rubaiyat (derived from the Arabic language root for ""four""), meaning ""quatrains"".

17571033,2,US,true,3.73,"A brilliant new version of theOdysseyfrom one of the most accomplished translators of our time.Stephen Mitchell'sIliadcaused a stir on its publication and was chosen as one of the New Yorker's favorite books for 2011. Now Mitchell brings his vivid poetic power to theOdyssey, the original epic voyage into the unknown that has inspired other creative work for millennia--from ancient poems to modern fiction and movies. With its consummately modern hero, full of guile and wit, always prepared to reinvent himself, the Odysseyis perfectly suited to our times. Mitchell's translation brings it to life for those who have never read it before or have tried and given up.
Twentieth-century translators of the Odysseywere either too literal or overreached for poetic effects, which produced awkward syntax and made the story hard to follow. Mitchell's version keeps the syntax straightforward and the diction close to spoken English, yet his meter re-creates the oceanic music of the ancient Greek. In addition, this is the first translation to benefit from advances in modern textual scholarship.
Just as Mitchell ""re-energized the Iliadfor a new generation"" (The Sunday Telegraph), in his Odysseyhe has created the noblest, clearest, and most captivating rendition of one of the defining masterpieces of Western literature.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571033-the-odyssey,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571033-the-odyssey,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412545226m/17571033.jpg,17,3356006,The Odyssey:,The Odyssey:

EXPERTS ON THIS BOOK:
Prof. Hugh Fox (Professor Emeritus of Michigan State University, archaeologist, editor, writer, and iconic poet of international fame) has liked and appreciated this book in these words:
""One of the deepest, widest, most universal poetry books ever written about individual spirituality in a world-wide context. And Chaswal has the single most original view of Christianity in all its totality and specifics of anyone else on the contemporary scene. What he wants is individual sanity, salvation, an escape from the depravities of the modern world into an ancient oneness with the universe, a kind of reworking of human spirituality, so that it really functions and Man as such can glide into, drift into individual completeness. Christ isn't someone distant for Chaswal but someone he goes to Jerusalem to meet and converse with, all about a return to essential humanity. He hates greed, selfishness, in a sense the whole mechanical-cybernetic drifting of the modern world into a flow that is turning humankind into something minor and self-involved that it was never intended to be. Chaswal identifies with blacks, whites, Indians in India, Americans....you name it, he identifies with it. Universalism at its most universal. You read his poetry and you go through a kind of spiritual renewal. One of, perhaps, THE most spiritually renewing poet on the contemporary scene. WONDERFUL WORK! I really loved it.""
In the words of Candice James, Poet Laureate, New Westminster, BC CANADA :
""Deepak Chaswal is a master of words and weaves them into an intricate pattern that indelibly imprints the mind. His poem, ""Man"", tells succinctly the story of our existence from cradle to grave. In ""Day of Judgement"" Chaswal's poetry wanders the bleak alleyways of ignorance, atrocity, and man's inhumanity to man. He then leads us from the paths of iniquity into a gentle serenity with his musing in his poem ""Joy"". Deepak Chaswal bares his soul to bleed onto every page that you may be further enriched for reading it.""
Felix Nicolau (prolific poet, novelist, critic and Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at ""Hyperion"" University of Bucharest, Romania, where he is the Dean of Faculty of Letters and Foreign Languages) observes:
""Now and again Christ pops up before our eyes - bearer of intense messages. But when He emerges in front of the Poet there'll be some mind-twisting revelation for sure. Deepak Chaswal regretfully conjures apocalypse and playfully takes snapshots of voracious appearances. His art can't sit legs crossed and contemplate ivory towers. Every verse in this book testifies for or against something, proving the intellectual and political charge of contemporary poetry. Then, the details and frailties of a world in turmoil are cunningly surprised by the poet. Such an art refutes the confined vision of Cyclops and energetically assumes the thousand-eyed body of Argus. More than ever, the poet is a seer, full of experience and innocence in the same time.""
Philip Ellis , a freelance critic, poet and scholar from Australia comments:
""The poetry of Deepak Chaswal's Meeting with Christ and Other Poems invokes the exterior world in language both spiritual and secular, so that the world becomes something newer and stranger than what it was in the past. It is also a melange of images and motifs which appear, disappear and reappear throughout this collection, and it is a body of work unique to his life experiences and his worldview. It is a poetry where the tropes of Western religion, such as Christ and angels, encounter Chaswal's eastern milieu and are transformed, made, again, strange. The result of all this is a verbal and formal richness, using rhyme and free verse alike in its dexterity, and poems that are both distinctive.",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18334644-meeting-with-christ-and-other-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18334644-meeting-with-christ-and-other-poems,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376746223m/18334644.jpg,78,25882971,Meeting With Christ and Other Poems,Meeting With Christ and Other Poems

I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease....observing a spear of summer grass. So begins Leaves of Grass, the first great American poem and indeed, to this day, the greatest and most essentially American poem in all our national literature. The publication of Leaves of Grass in July 1855 was a landmark event in literary history. Ralph Waldo Emerson judged the book ""the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed."" Nothing like the volume had ever appeared before. Everything about it--the unusual jacket and title page, the exuberant preface, the twelve free-flowing, untitled poems embracing every realm of experience--was new. The 1855 edition broke new ground in its relaxed style, which prefigured free verse; in its sexual candor; in its images of racial bonding and democratic togetherness; and in the intensity of its affirmation of the sanctity of the physical world. This Anniversary Edition captures the typeface, design and layout of the original edition supervised by Whitman himself. Today's readers get a sense of the ""ur-text"" of Leaves of Grass, the first version of this historic volume, before Whitman made many revisions of both format and style. The volume also boasts an afterword by Whitman authority David Reynolds, in which he discusses the 1855 edition in its social and cultural contexts: its background, its reception, and its contributions to literary history. There is also an appendix containing the early responses to the volume, including Emerson's letter, Whitman's three self-reviews, and the twenty other known reviews published in various newspapers and magazines. This special volume will be a must-have keepsake for fans of Whitman and lovers of American poetry.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21954848-leaves-of-grass,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21954848-leaves-of-grass,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,8,28117,Leaves of Grass (150th Anniversary Edition),Leaves of Grass (150th Anniversary Edition)

The Lifeboat
All night in his lifeboat my father sang
to keep the voices of the other men
who cried in the wreckage from reaching him,
he sang what he knew of the requiem,
of the hit parade and the bits of hymns,
he sang until he would never sing again,
scalding his raw throat with sea-water
until his ribs heaved, until the salt
wept from his eyes on dry land,
flecked at his lips in his squalling rages,
streaked the sheets in his night sweats
as night after night the reassembled ship
scattered its parts on the shore of his bed,
and the lifeboat eased him out again
to drown each night among singing men.

Born in the town of Bsharri in the north of modern-day Lebanon (then part of Ottoman Mount Lebanon), as a young man he immigrated with his family to the United States, where he studied art and began his literary career, writing in both English and Arabic. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero. He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture.

From its opening lines--""The funeral director opened the coffin/And there he was alone/From the waist up""--Hirsch's account is poignantly direct & open to the strange vicissitudes & tricks of grief. He tells the story of how a once unstoppable child, who suffered from various developmental disorders, turned into a tattooed, impulsive, rebellious young adult. Hirsch mixes his tale of Gabriel with the stories of other poets through the centuries who have also lost children, & expresses his feelings through theirs.

There is a sorrow beyond all grief, which leads to joy. And a fragility out of whose depths emerges strength. There is a hollow space too vast for words through which we pass with each loss, out of whose darkness we are sanctioned into being."" ~ Bri Maya Tiwari
That quote astutely describes not only my life, but the poetry in ""Anatomy of a Poet"".
One of six children, I grew up in a small Ohio town and married my high school sweetheart at nineteen. A Vietnam War widow at twenty, I went on to marry and divorce twice. I made a lot of choices, some good, some not so good, but as one of the poems in the book ends, ""...at least I made choices. How sad for those who merely hitchhike along, never daring to choose at all.""
""Anatomy of a Poet"" was written over a period of nearly forty years. The poetry is rich with memoir, rife with humor and, at times, sensual in nature.
Poetry can be daunting and hard to understand, but it doesn't have to be. I feel a poet has an obligation to write in a way that everyone can understand. Poems should flow softly through a poet's words, their meanings easily touching the heart and mind of its reader. If a poem comes from the heart, it will reach other hearts.

I haven't read through the whole book: poetry is not something to be rushed at, but something to be savored. Each poem evokes a different mood, a different response, so I like to read one occasionally, almost as a thought for the day.
Many of the poems are love songs with no need of music: they create their own in my heart. They resonate with me as a long-married lover.
If asked before if I liked reading poetry, I'd have pulled a face and said, 'Mmm...sometimes...if it rhymes, if it has rhythm."" But it doesn't seem to matter whether CJ Heck's poems have rhythm or rhyme, they are beautiful.
I would recommend this book to all lovers of poetry and, especially, to all who think they are not.""

They had lost everything in their lives. After witnessing the whole world descend to darkness, they took it upon themselves to be saviors of humanity. Besides being a love story between Yaser and Yasmeen, it is also a tale of how four friends were able not only to inspire love into the Earth, but also to redeem the people of all layers of Hell into Heaven. By doing so, they've angered not only the police force on Earth, but also all the demons in the afterlife.
The four friends went on massively crazy adventures, breaking rules whatever they were. They sought out pleasure despite boredom, and joy despite sorrow. Eventually, they formed a musical cult with odd rituals and customs. After spending much time in this cult, they eventually expanded it to spray paint slogans of love all throughout the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
An Excerpt: This Giant Mist
And so the heralds of the world end up becoming dead
When it is contained in the words they've sincerely said
That they wished to appeal to God's intentions up above
It seems that they would be killed for preaching love
And the world will always be disconnected without love, and so will there be unrest
And even though all heralds of fate do try their best
To promote this state of unity, amongst both sides
It seems that such heralds would have surely died
We've always had this side quest, to inspire ways to invoke upon the world construction
Throughout the world, to avoid a world war three's destruction
Yet apathy prevails, when hope seems to never exist
And so nothing will remove from the world this giant mist",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28080536-yaser-and-yasmeen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28080536-yaser-and-yasmeen,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1449088831m/28080536.jpg,1,47429743,Yaser and Yasmeen: A Novel In Verse/ An Epic Poem,Yaser and Yasmeen: A Novel In Verse/ An Epic Poem

In House of Lords and Commons, the revelatory and vital new collection of poems from the winner of the 2013 Whiting Writers' Award in poetry, Ishion Hutchinson returns to the difficult beauty of the Jamaican landscape with remarkable lyric precision. Here, the poet holds his world in full focus but at an astonishing angle: from the violence of the seventeenth-century English Civil War as refracted through a mythic sea wanderer, right down to the dark interior of love.
These poems arrange the contemporary continuum of home and abroad into a wonderment of cracked narrative sequences and tumultuous personae.

The Rain in Portugal, a title that admits he's not much of a rhymer, sheds Collins's ironic light on such subjects as travel and art, cats and dogs, loneliness and love, beauty and death. His tones range from the whimsical ""the dogs of Minneapolis . . . / have no idea they're in Minneapolis"" to the elegiac in a reaction to the death of Seamus Heaney. A student of the everyday, here Collins contemplates a weather vane, a still life painting, the calendar, and a child lost at a beach. His imaginative fabrications have Shakespeare flying comfortably in first class and Keith Richards supporting the globe on his head. By turns entertaining, engaging, and enlightening, The Rain in Portugalamounts to another chorus of poems from one of the most respected and familiar voices in the world of American poetry.
On Rhyme
It's possible that a stitch in time
might save as many as twelve or as few as three,
and I have no trouble remembering
that September has thirty days.
So do June, November, and April.
I like a cat wearing a chapeau or a trilby,
Little Jack Horner sitting on a sofa,
old men who are not from Nantucket,
and how life can seem almost unreal
when you are gently rowing a boat down a stream.
That's why instead of recalling today
that it mostly pours in Spain,
I am going to picture the rain in Portugal,
how it falls on the hillside vineyards,
on the surface of the deep harbors
where fishing boats are swaying,
and in the narrow alleys of the cities
where three boys in tee shirts
are kicking a soccer ball in the rain,
ignoring the window-cries of their mothers.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28502750-the-rain-in-portugal,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28502750-the-rain-in-portugal,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463156930m/28502750.jpg,146,48656094,The Rain in Portugal:  Poems,The Rain in Portugal:  Poems

He recalls what it is like to ride a runt calf, travel back in time to visit his newly wed parents, and sell roadside zucchini.

Markham is intrigued with how language tries but ultimately fails to hold memory in place. She grapples with the translation of words and feeling and shows how this failure also brings a searching for belief - a word that repeats throughout these poems - in a world that cannot allow it.

Robert Oppenheimer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Jung and Herman Hesse. It is considered among the most important texts in the history of literature and philosophy. The Bhagavad Gita comprises exactly 700 verses, and is a part of the Mahabharata. The teacher of the Bhagavad Gita is Lord Krishna, who is revered by Hindus as a manifestation of God (Parabrahman) itself, and is referred to within as Bhagavan, the Divine One.
The content of the Gita is the conversation between Lord Krishna and the Pandava Prince Arjuna taking place on the battlefield before the start of the Kurukshetra War. Responding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma about fighting his own cousins, Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince, and elaborates on different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies, with examples and analogies.

With a poet like Cavafy, who was so precisely tuned to the idiom of his peers, it is even more important to update the English versions of his poems frequently, so that they have the same immediate resonance with the times as the originals had with their time. This is, of course, an impossible task. There is no single word, much less any phrase, that has exactly the same weight and hierarchy of primary and secondary meanings in another language. Add to that the differences in sound patterns and rhythmic signatures or emphases, and it becomes clear that the best one can do is to approximate, sometimes by straying from the awkwardness of literal, dictionary definitions, the poetic effects of the original poems. Robert Lowell called his attempts ""Imitations"" and I think that the ambition and humility of that designation makes it a more or less accurate label for what is presented here, English versions of a celebrated body of work that could never have been written in English, much less in Canadian English with our vastly different history and culture, different even from the English that evolved in Britain over many centuries. Certainly there are problematics that have remained unresolved, and occasional passages of unavoidable clumsiness, but we have tried to approximate both Cavafy's intimate, precise sense of idiomatic speech, and his consummate ear for traditional forms revitalized by the Demotic Greek of Alexandria. If we haven't fully succeeded, our hope is that something of the poet's distinctive genius and skill remains, and remains accessible to our readers, if only as a trace element here and there, or in the cumulative force of the book as a whole.

10593697,5,US,true,4.25,"William Butler Yeats, whom many consider this century's greatest poet, began as a bard of the Celtic Twilight, reviving legends and Rosicrucian symbols. By the early 1900s, however, he was moving away from plush romanticism, his verse morphing from the incantatory rhythms of ""I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree"" into lyrics ""as cold and passionate as the dawn."" At every stage, however, Yeats plays a multiplicity of poetic roles. There is the romantic lover of ""When You Are Old"" and ""A Poet to His Beloved"" (""I bring you with reverent Hands / The books of my numberless dreams...""). And there are the far more bitter celebrations of Maud Gonne, who never accepted his love and engaged in too much politicking for his taste:
Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
There is also the poet of conscience - and confrontation. His 1931 ""Remorse for Intemperate Speech"" ends:
Out of Ireland have we come.
Great hatred, little room,
Maimed us at the start.
I carried from my mother's womb
A fanatic heart.
Yeats was to explore several more sides of himself, and of Ireland, before his Last Poemsof 1938-39. Many are difficult, some snobbish, others occult and spiritualist. As Brendan Kennelly writes, Yeats ""produces both poppycock and sublimity in verse, sometimes closely together."" On the other hand, many prophetic masterworks are poppycock-free - for example, ""The Second Coming""
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...
and such inquiries into inspiration as ""Among School Children"" (""O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, / How can we know the dancer from the dance?""). And at his best, Yeats extends the meaning of love poetry beyond the obviously romantic: love becomes a revolutionary emotion, attaching the poet to friends, history, and the passionate life of the mind. - Kerry Fried",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10593697-collected-poems-by,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10593697-collected-poems-by,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,93,629495,Collected Poems [ By: William Butler Yeats ],Collected Poems [ By: William Butler Yeats ]

Then, from the middle of the eighteenth century onward, that enjoyment was enriched by a surge of popular interest in botany. Besides exploring the relationship between poetic and scientific responses to the green world within the context of humanity???s changing concepts of its own place in the ecosphere, Molly Mahood considers the part that flowering plants played in the daily lives and therefore in the literary work of a number of writers who could all be called poet-botanists: Erasmus Darwin, George Crabbe, John Clare, John Ruskin and D.

Enkidu is trapped by a temple prostitute, civilised through sexual experience and brought to Gilgamesh. They become best friends and battle evil together.

""Like most people I, too, have been blindsided by personal grief now and again over the years. And I have an increasingly keen sense that, wherever I am, someone nearby is suffering now.
For that reason, I lately have settled in to mull the matter over, gathering my troubled wits to undertake a difficult essay, more like what we used to call an assay, really--an earnest inquiry. I am thinking of it just now as a study in suffering, by which I hope to find some sense in affliction, hoping--just as I have come to hope about experience in general--to make something of it."" 
Is there meaning in our afflictions?
With the thoughtfulness of a pilgrim and the prose of a poet, Scott Cairns takes us on a soul-baring journey through ""the puzzlement of our afflictions."" Probing ancient Christian wisdom for revelation in his own pain, Cairns challenges us toward a radical revision of the full meaning and breadth of human suffering. 
Clear-eyed and unsparingly honest, this new addition to the literature of suffering is reminiscent of The Year of Magical Thinking as well as the works of C. S. Lewis. Cairns points us toward hope in the seasons of our afflictions, because ""in those trials in our lives that we do not choose but press through--a stillness, a calm, and a hope become available to us.""",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10391779-end-of-suffering,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10391779-end-of-suffering,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328755032m/10391779.jpg,3,6992729,End of Suffering: Finding Purpose in Pain,End of Suffering: Finding Purpose in Pain

His writings serve as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, archaic Greek astronomy and ancient timekeeping. Of the many works attributed to Hesiod, three survive complete and many more in fragmentary state. They include Alexandrian papyri, some dating from as early as the 1st century BC, and manuscripts written from the eleventh century forward. He wrote a poem of some 800 verses, the Works and Days, which revolves around two general truths: labour is the universal lot of Man, but he who is willing to work will get by. Tradition also attributes the Theogony, a poem which uses the same epic verse-form as the Works and Days, to Hesiod. A short poem traditionally attributed to Hesiod is The Shield of Heracles. Several additional poems were sometimes ascribed to Hesiod: Aegimius, Astrice, Chironis Hypothecae, Idaei Dactyli, Wedding of Ceyx, Great Works (presumably an expanded Works and Days), Great Eoiae (presumably an expanded Catalogue of Women), Melampodia and Ornithomantia.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19016323-theogony,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19016323-theogony,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,30,375246,Theogony,Theogony

23192926,1,US,true,4.1,"Some kind of war happened at some time or another and continued for quite some time to come.So begins Bombyonder, Reb Livingston's blistering, kaleidoscopic, post-bomb-blast shrapnel-storm of a book. Bombs, masks, machinery, birds buried at the bottoms of women, emerge and recede in the blistering landscape. You ride in a vehicle with a thousand gears, each ratcheting the velocity upward. You will encounter Mrs. Butterworth, Home Depot, Rapunzel, Facebook, Leona Helmsley and countless others in a blur of narratives, dreams, texts and diary entries. When you reach for your seat belt, which you will, you will come up with Medusa's snakes in your clenched hands. But Bombyonder is not merely a scathing, slicingly funny assemblage. Livingston devises a pulsing, haywire logic that somehow rivets the parts to each other and the reader to the page. Through the marvel of her language, the book becomes a shimmering whole; a miracle met like the first mirror. Bombyonder transcends any sense of ""experimentation,"" and occupies, essentially, its own genre. I came from a long line of fusesLivingston's central character reports. Leave your cardboard containers at the door. Bring your own oxygen. You cannot be ready or more ready. The narrator tells us: Between a gauntlet of opposing dogs, she walked between two lines. This was her path. Livingston has delivered a fabulous, mind bending book. Honestly, I do not know how she survived the writing of it.

For a thousand years and more before the Europeans came, a great culture flourished in these islands. The masterworks of classical Haida sculpture, now enshrined in many of the world's great museums, range from exquisite tiny amulets to magnificent huge housepoles. Classical Haida literature is every bit as various and fine. It extends from tiny jewels crafted by master songmakers to elaborate mythic cycles lasting many hours.
The linguist and ethnographer John Swanton took dictation from the last great Haida-speaking storytellers, poets and historians from the fall of 1900 through the summer of 1901. His Haida hosts and colleagues had been raised in a wholly oral world where the mythic and the personal interpenetrate completely. They joined forces with their visitor, consciously creating a great treasury of Haida oral literature in written form.

33810193,2,US,true,4.21,"Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 - May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33810193-the-complete-poems-of-emily-dickinson,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33810193-the-complete-poems-of-emily-dickinson,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,13,1443553,The Complete Poems Of Emily Dickinson,The Complete Poems Of Emily Dickinson

33866948,1,US,true,4.35,"A man disappears. The woman who loves him is left scarred and haunted. In her fierce, one-of-a-kind debut, Rebecca Lindenberg tells the story--in verse--of her passionate relationship with Craig Arnold, a much-respected poet who disappeared in 2009 while hiking a volcano in Japan. Lindenberg's billowing, I-contain-multitudes style lays bare the poet's sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, at once plainspoken and musically elaborate.
Regarding her role in Arnold's story, Lindenberg writes with clear-eyed humility and endearing dignity: ""The girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she's famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She's not / daft, after all."" And then later, playfully, of her travels in Italy with the poet, her lover: ""The carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears."" Every poem in this collection bursts with humor, pathos, verve--and an utterly unique, soulful voice.
This widely anticipated debut, already selected as a finalist for several prominent book awards, marks the first collection in the newly minted McSweeney's Poetry Series.

Armantrout accesses the strangeness of everyday occurrence with wit, sensuality, and an eye alert to underlying trauma, as in the poem Price Points where a man conducts an imaginary orchestra but gets no points for originality. In their investigations of the cosmically mundane, Armantrout's poems use an extraordinary microscopic lens--even when she's glancing backwards from the outer reaches of space.

He attended art school for a short while, but soon found that his talents and interest lay in poetry rather than painting. He came to prominence during a tumultuous period in Irish history, when he struggled with the idea of an independent Irish identity. Yeats dealt constantly with the contradictions he felt in his nature and in life, and spent much of his life seeking out a philosophical system to resolve this conflict. The first edition of ""The Countess Cathleen"" appeared in 1892, but underwent several revisions over the next thirty years as Yeats' vision of poetry and theatre evolved.

18942719,7,US,true,3.93,"The legend of Faust grew up in the sixteenth century, a time of transition between medieval and modern culture in Germany. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) adopted the story of the wandering conjuror who accepts Mephistopheles's offer of a pact, selling his soul for the devil's greater knowledge; over a period of 60 years he produced one of the greatest dramatic and poetic masterpieces of European literature.
David Luke's recent translation, specially commissioned for The World's Classics series, has all the virtues of previous classic translations of Faust, and none of their shortcomings. Cast in rhymed verse, following the original, it preserves the essence of Goethe's meaning without sacrifice to archaism or over-modern idiom. It is as near an `equivalent' rendering of the German as has been achieved.

This is the love story of Lizzie and Henry, child prodigies who befriend each other, grow ever closer, and eventually sing, before the world's most important people ""Wessingham Awaits,"" a song that is at once enchanting and forbidden. The night of their last performance of ""Wessingham Awaits,"" their music teacher is murdered and Lizzie and Henry are forcefully separated.

20496380,1,US,true,4.25,"SAID's 99 Psalms are poems of praise and lament, of questioning and wondering. In the tradition of the Hebrew psalmist, they find their voice in exile, in this case one that is both existential and geographical. His decision to include 99 in this collection recalls the ancient Muslim tradition that ascribes 99 names to Allah, though the ""lord""whom this psalmist addresses is not bounded by this or any other religious tradition. As psalms that turn to the ""lord"" with a lover's vulnerability, they avoid every trace of sentimentality. Rather, they seek to open us to the mystery of human life, warning us of the difficulties we face in our attempts to live peaceably together in the midst of our differences.
""These are prayers for passionate seekers and confounded believers alike, Muslim, Jewish or Christian. Taut-lined cries to God evoke the Hebrew psalms, yet their voice is from our world - speaking fiercely to what our current world forces upon us: the pierced and anguished heart in exile, wrestling Jacob-like with God while taking human flesh seriously to call our religious cliches into account. I know of no other prayer collection that propels us to such intimacy with the absence and presence of God.""

This second collection is equally divided between poems that, in their verbal jugglery and humorous bias, seem to qualify as ""light"" and poems that, one way or other, cross the problematic border into the general realm of poetry. The distinction cannot be clear-cut. The poet is consistently concerned with Man's cosmic embarrassment, and the same vision illuminates the creatures of ""The High Hearts"" and ""Seagulls.""

Excerpt from The Princess
Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day
Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun
Up to the people; thither flock'd at noon
His tenants, wife and child, and thither half
The neighboring borough with their Institute,
Of which he was the patron. I was there
From college, visiting the son, -the son
A Walter too, -with others of our set,
Five others: we were seven at Vivian-place.
And me that morning Walter show'd the house,
Greek, set with busts. From vases in the hall
Flowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,
Grew side by side; and on the pavement lay
Carved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,
Huge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time:
And on the tables every clime and age
Jumbled together; celts and calumets,
Claymore and snow-shoe, toys in lava, fans
Of sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,
Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,
The cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs
From the isles of palm; and higher on the walls,
Betwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,
His own forefathers' arms and armor hung.
And 'this, ' he said, 'was Hugh's at Agin-court;
And that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon.
A good knight he! we keep a chronicle
With all about him, '-which he brought, and I
Dived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights
Half-legend, half-historic, counts and kings
Who laid about them at their wills and died;
And mixt with these a lady, one that arm'd
Her own fair head, and sallying thro' the gate,
Had beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11626820-the-princess,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11626820-the-princess,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,18,1026811,The Princess,The Princess

24722173,3,US,true,3.73,"La odisea es un poema epico griego compuesto por 24 cantos, atribuido al poeta griego Homero. Se cree que fue escrito en el siglo VIII a. C., en los asentamientos que Grecia tenia en la costa oeste del Asia Menor (actual Turquia asiatica). Segun otros autores, la Odisea se completa en el siglo VII a. C. a partir de poemas que solo describian partes de la obra actual. Fue originalmente escrita en lo que se ha llamado dialecto homerico. Narra la vuelta a casa del heroe griego Odiseo (Ulises en latin) tras la Guerra de Troya. Odiseo tarda veinte anos en regresar a la isla de Itaca, donde poseia el titulo de rey, periodo durante el cual su hijo Telemaco y su esposa Penelope han de tolerar en su palacio a los pretendientes que buscan desposarla (pues ya creian muerto a Odiseo), al mismo tiempo que consumen los bienes de la familia.
La mejor arma de Odiseo es su metis o astucia. Gracias a su inteligencia --ademas de la ayuda provista por Palas Atenea, hija de Zeus Cronida-- es capaz de escapar de los continuos problemas a los que ha de enfrentarse por designio de los dioses. Para esto, planea diversas artimanas, bien sean fisicas --como pueden serlo disfraces-- o con audaces y enganosos discursos de los que se vale para conseguir sus objetivos.
El poema es, junto a la Iliada, uno de los primeros textos de la epica grecolatina y por tanto de la literatura occidental. Se cree que el poema original fue transmitido por via oral durante siglos por aedos que recitaban el poema de memoria, alterandolo consciente o inconscientemente. Era transmitida en dialectos de la Antigua Grecia. Ya en el siglo IX a. C., con la reciente aparicion del alfabeto, tanto la Odisea como la Iliada pudieron ser las primeras obras en ser transcritas, aunque la mayoria de la critica se inclina por datarlas en el siglo VIII a. C. El texto homerico mas antiguo que conocemos es la version de Aristarco de Samotracia (siglo II a. C.). El poema esta escrito usando una metrica llamada hexametro dactilico. Cada linea de la Odisea original estaba formada por seis unidades o pies, siendo cada pie dactilo o espondeo. Los primeros cinco pies eran dactilos y el ultimo podia ser un espondeo o bien un troqueo.

Amy Berkowitz's brilliant book-length lyric essay is now available as an ebook! Named after the famously vague diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, a little-understood chronic pain condition that mostly affects women, the book describes Berkowitz's experiences in short, episodic vignettes that are sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking. In straightforward, haunting and epigrammatic prose, Berkowitz makes the link between rape, trauma and women's sick bodies clear and personal. While that might sound like a bummer, the book's beauty makes it uplifting to read.

We hear our own fears and wants echoing back to us from the deeply human center of this book. --Julie Marie Wade, author of Postage Due: Poems & Prose Poems and When I Was Straight: Poems
In the rich and vivid poems of Viable, Julie Hensley rings the changes of a girl child's life, from riding stick-horses in her yard in Big Stone Gap to sexual discovery after sixteen summers, to homesickness in her first apartment, then to love, marriage and, motherhood. The path may be familiar, but none of it is simple, and there are sharp turns of grief and reckoning along the way. Rooted in the natural world--mountain, desert, prairie, seashore--and seeing herself as a creature among creatures, Hensley offers us words of life in all its uncertainty, knowing that ""Creation is still a gift/ a yolk bobbing uncertainly/ inside a fragile shell."" --George Ella Lyon, Kentucky Poet Laureate 2015-2016, author of Many-Storied House",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29423961-viable,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29423961-viable,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,1,48049193,Viable,Viable
20756093,2,US,true,4.09,"One of the greatest poets of the Silver Age, Boris Pasternak (February 10, 1890 - May 30, 1960) became known in the west after he was awarded the 1958 Nobel Laureate in Literature and was forced by the Russian authorities to decline the prize. This scandal won him a large audience in the west and his novel, Dr. Zhivago became an instant success. However, contrary to popular belief, Boris Pasternak has never actively rebelled against the Soviet regime. His poetry has always reflected his inner self and was not dictated by the atmosphere of the epoch. In Russia, where the novel, Dr, Zhivago, had been banned until the late 1980's, Boris Pasternak was primarily known for his work as a poet. Boris Pasternak, whose first true love was music, brings a unique sense of melody to his poetry. Barely a whisper, one almost needs to overhear the subtle song in his words. It is this quality of his poetry that sets him apart from his contemporaries and makes his work moving and unforgettable.
Nearly all of the poems from Dr. Zhivago (with the exceptions of ""Wedding,"" ""Star of Nativity,"" and ""The Miracle,"" which proved to be too difficult to translate adequately) are included in this dual-language edition, as well as some other poetry written throughout his life.

26185836,1,US,true,3.95,"The precipitous cliffs, rolling headlands, and rocky inlets of the California coast come alive in the poetry of John Robinson Jeffers, an icon of the environmental movement. In this concise and accessible biography, Jeffers scholar James Karman reveals deep insights into this passionate and complex figure and establishes Jeffers as a leading American poet of prophetic vision.
In a move that would define his life's work, Jeffers' family relocated to California from Pennsylvania in 1903 when he was sixteen. While a graduate student at the University of Southern California he met Una Call Kuster, a student who was the wife of a prominent Los Angeles attorney, and they began a scandalous affair that made the front page of the Los Angeles Times. They eventually married and escaped to Carmel, California to write poetry; there they would spend the rest of their lives.
At the height of his popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, Jeffers became one of the few poets ever featured on the cover of Timemagazine, and posthumously put on a U.S. postage stamp. Writing by kerosene lamp in a granite tower that he had built himself, his vivid and descriptive poetry of the coast evoked the difficulty and beauty of the wild and inspired photographers such as Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. He was known for long narrative blank verse that shook up the national literary scene, but in the 1940s his interest in the Greek classics led to several adaptations which were staged on Broadway to great success.
Inspiring later artists from Charles Bukowski to Czeslaw Milosz and even the Beach Boys, Robinson Jeffers' contribution to American letters is skillfully brought back out of the shadows of history in this compelling biography of a complex man of poetic genius who wrote so powerfully of the astonishing beauty of nature.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26185836-robinson-jeffers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26185836-robinson-jeffers,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,6,43112033,Robinson Jeffers: Poet and Prophet,Robinson Jeffers: Poet and Prophet

The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive.

19887723,1,US,true,4.42,"A groundbreaking translation of the epic work of one of the great minds of the nineteenth century
Giacomo Leopardi was the greatest Italian poet of the nineteenth century and was recognized by readers from Nietzsche to Beckett as one of the towering literary figures in Italian history. To many, he is the finest Italian poet after Dante. (Jonathan Galassi's translation of Leopardi's Cantiwas published by FSG in 2010.)
He was also a prodigious scholar of classical literature and philosophy, and a voracious reader in numerous ancient and modern languages. For most of his writing career, he kept an immense notebook, known as the Zibaldone, or ""hodge-podge,"" as Harold Bloom has called it, in which Leopardi put down his original, wide-ranging, radically modern responses to his reading. His comments about religion, philosophy, language, history, anthropology, astronomy, literature, poetry, and love are unprecedented in their brilliance and suggestiveness, and the Zibaldone, which was only published at the turn of the twentieth century, has been recognized as one of the foundational books of modern culture. Its 4,500-plus pages have never been fully translated into English until now, when a team under the auspices of Michael Caesar and Franco D'Intino of the Leopardi Centre in Birmingham, England, have spent years producing a lively, accurate version.

Per scoprirlo, basta leggere i suoi versi: chi lo ha fatto giura di non essere piu riuscito a smettere. Molti si sono emozionati, tutti confessano di aver riso a crepapelle, c'e chi alla fine si e pure innamorato. In questa raccolta ci sono poesie per tutte le occasioni: quelle da leggere da soli la sera, accoccolati sotto il piumone, e quelle da declamare a voce alta; quelle per fare colpo sulla persona che ti piace; quelle per chi sogna labbra lontane. Ci sono poesie per chi e stato mollato e per chi, piu modestamente, aspetta soltanto di far bollire le carote. Ci sono fidanzate vecchie e nuove, sbronze sotto la luna, invasioni di zombie. Ma anche tanta vita quotidiana: l'ispirazione che non arriva, i black-out estivi e un mondo di rondini, muratori e passanti ubriachi che si fa beffe del poeta al lavoro. Di nazisti, invece, non ce n'e nemmeno uno: il tasso di baci presente in queste pagine non l'avrebbe consentito. Catalano e il poeta che ha infranto le gabbie in cui si vorrebbero relegati i poeti per prendersi uno spazio di cui si ignorava l'esistenza, sorprendendo critica e pubblico con i suoi reading in giro per l'Italia, e adesso ci racconta i ""piccoli fatti felici"" della vita e dell'amore come solo lui sa fare.

In this innovative rendition of The Oresteia, the poet, translator, and essayist Anne Carson combines three different visions--Aischylos' Agamemnon, Sophokles' Elektra, and Euripides' Orestes--giving birth to a wholly new experience of the classic Greek triumvirate of vengeance. After the murder of her daughter Iphegenia by her husband Agamemnon, Klytaimestra exacts a mother's revenge, murdering Agamemnon and his mistress, Kassandra. Displeased with Klytaimestra's actions, Apollo calls on her son, Orestes, to avenge his father's death with the help of his sister Elektra. In the end, Orestes, driven mad by the Furies for his bloody betrayal of family, and Elektra are condemned to death by the people of Argos, and must justify their actions--signaling a call to change in society, a shift from the capricious governing of the gods to the rule of manmade law. Carson's accomplished rendering combines elements of contemporary vernacular with the traditional structures and rhetoric of Greek tragedy, opening up the plays to a modern audience. In addition to its accessibility, the wit and dazzling morbidity of her prose sheds new light on the saga for scholars. Anne Carson's Oresteia is a watershed translation, a death-dance of vengeance and passion not to be missed.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12010547-an-oresteia,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12010547-an-oresteia,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1431904363m/12010547.jpg,51,53584369,An Oresteia: Agamemnon by Aiskhylos; Elektra by Sophokles; Orestes by Euripides,An Oresteia: Agamemnon by Aiskhylos; Elektra by Sophokles; Orestes by Euripides

When Leaves of Grass was first published in 1855 as a slim tract of twelve untitled poems, Walt Whitman was still an unknown. But his self-published volume soon became a landmark of poetry, introducing the world to a new and uniquely American form. The ""father of free verse,"" Whitman drew upon the cadence of simple, even idiomatic speech to ""sing"" such themes as democracy, sexuality, and frank autobiography.
Throughout his prolific writing career, Whitman continually revised his work and expanded Leaves of Grass, which went through nine, substantively different editions, culminating in the final, authoritative ""Death-bed Edition."" Now the original 1855 version and the ""Death-bed Edition"" of 1892 have been brought together in a single volume, allowing the reader to experience the total scope of Whitman's genius, which produced love lyrics, visionary musings, glimpses of nightmare and ecstasy, celebrations of the human body and spirit, and poems of loneliness, loss, and mourning.

Gerard Manley Hopkins deserves his place among the greatest poets in the English language. He ranks seventh among the most frequently reprinted English-language poets, surpassed only by Shakespeare, Donne, Blake, Dickinson, Yeats, and Wordsworth.
Yet when the English Jesuit priest died of typhoid fever at age forty-four, he considered his life a failure. He never would have suspected that his poems, which would not be published for another twenty-nine years, would eventually change the course of modern poetry and influence such poets as W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Geoffrey Hill, and Seamus Heaney. Like his contemporaries Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, Hopkins revolutionized poetic language.
And yet we love Hopkins not only for his literary genius but for the hard-won faith that finds expression in his verse. Who else has captured the thunderous voice of God and the grandeur of his creation on the written page as Hopkins has? Seamlessly weaving together selections from Hopkins's poems, letters, journals, and sermons, Peggy Ellsberg lets the poet tell the story of a life-long struggle with faith that gave birth to some of the best poetry of all time.

His oeuvre is steeped in a poetic sensibility, marked by a lyricism rare in the world of Hindi cinema. Born in 1934, Gulzar's journey as a poet began with the Progressive Writers' Movement. Today, he is regarded as one of India's foremost Urdu Poets, unparalleled in his exploration of human relationships and the insights and sensitivity with which he addresses the many facets of daily life.
Whether evoking an abiding nostalgia for yesterday (The Heart Seeks), lamenting the lack of time to spend with a beloved (A Day to Spend), or composing an elegy for a tree uprooted by a storms (Amaltas), Gulzar poetry reflects his keen observation of life and the environment around him.
Without in any way compromising on artistry or lyricism, his poems incorporate the mundane and the everyday to create vivid images, like in Clothes, where the act of washing and drying clothes becomes a metaphor for a relationship gone wrong, or Monsoon which draws an unforgettable parallel between the rainwater gushing through streets and young children returning home victorious in a match.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19408587-selected-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19408587-selected-poems,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,47,15191132,Selected Poems,Selected Poems

On returning to Alexandria he recited his poem again, to applause. In 196 Ptolemy Epiphanes made him the librarian of the Museum (the university) at Alexandria.

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter.[1] The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad, composed in the 8th century BC. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes and gods of Rome and Troy.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9581366-aenid,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9581366-aenid,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,221,288738,Aenid,Aenid

In Seven American Deaths and Disasters, Kenneth Goldsmith transcribes historic radio and television reports of national tragedies as they unfurl, revealing an extraordinarily rich linguistic panorama of passionate description. Taking its title from the series of Andy Warhol paintings by the same name, Goldsmith recasts the mundane as the iconic, creating a series of prose poems that encapsulate seven pivotal moments in recent American history: the John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and John Lennon assassinations, the space shuttle Challenger disaster, the Columbine shootings, 9/11, and the death of Michael Jackson. While we've become accustomed to watching endless reruns of these tragic spectacles--often to the point of cliche--once rendered in text, they become unfamiliar, and revealing new dimensions emerge.

Her beautifully lyrical prose glimpses beyond the harsh truth of everyday life and reminds us that the world isn't just how we see it; it's what we make it. Life is more than survival; it's a human experience that often seems otherworldly until we step beyond the boundaries set by convention and realize that we are each greater than the sum of our trials.

Within them festers something far more unnerving than unlit corners or unexplained noises: the case files left to moulder out of sight, out of conscience. Stephanie M. Wytovich forces your hands upon these crumbling, warped binders and exposes your mind to every taboo misfortune experienced by the outcast, exiled, misbegotten monsters and victims who have walked among us. The poetry contained in Hysteria performs internal body modification on its readers in an unrelenting fashion, employing broad-spectrum brutality treatment that spans the physical to the societal, as noted in Stoker Award winner Michael A. Arnzen's incisive introduction.
""Wytovich is nothing short of stupefying in her mastery of blunt impact verse. Even those jaded to the violent extremes of despair and rage in contemporary dark literature will find Wytovich piercing deep into the dark and unmapped vulnerabilities of her readers. Hysteria is a devastating debut.""

18899069,1,US,true,3.99,"Food and poetry: in so many ways, a natural pairing, from prayers over bread to street vendor songs. Poetry is said to feed the soul, each poem a delicious morsel. When read aloud, the best poems provide a particular joy for the mouth. Poems about food make these satisfactions explicit and complete. Of course, pages can and have been filled about food's elemental pleasures. And we all know food is more than food: it's identity and culture. Our days are marked by meals; our seasons are marked by celebrations. We plant in spring; harvest in fall. We labor over hot stoves; we treat ourselves to special meals out. Food is nurture; it's comfort; it's reward. While some of the poems here are explicitly about the food itself: the blackberries, the butter, the barbecue--all are evocative of the experience of eating. Many of the poems are also about the everything else that accompanies food: the memories, the company, even the politics. Kevin Young, distinguished poet, editor of this year's Best American Poetry, uses the lens of food - and his impeccable taste - to bring us some of the best poems, classic and current, period.

But to say these occurrences are mundane is only half the story. In poetry as achingly familiar as it is uncharted, Lewington feeds readers scenes of fumbling vulnerability, teeth-clenching honesty, and unrelenting self-awareness. There's something in every poem that rings true; the awkward intimacy of a dentist appointment, the doldrum of Mondays, the inexorable journey of stray hairs. But Lewington takes these occurrences further, with precision as sharp as a knife, making the familiar strange and shaking up the norm. A walk of shame becomes a woman's sphere for agency. Cold sores become a badge of power. New shoes, an insufficient patch. Uncompromisingly honest and hauntingly explorative, Put Me Down I'm Terrible is a celebration of the now, the everyday life, and the vulnerability that comes with it. As Lewington pens in one of the poems, ""I don't need to journey I'm gonna celebrate where I'm at.""

To be the poet, one must be the poem to be able to connect with their readers, if one cannot be the poet nor the poem, then it's not poetry.

13531366,5,US,true,4.39,"John Milton is, next to William Shakespeare, the most influential English poet, a writer whose work spans an incredible breadth of forms and subject matter. The Complete Poetry and Essential Prose of John Milton celebrates this author's genius in a thoughtfully assembled book that provides new modern-spelling versions of Milton's texts, expert commentary, and a wealth of other features that will please even the most dedicated students of Milton's canon. Edited by a trio of esteemed scholars, this volume is the definitive Milton for our time.
In these pages you will find all of Milton's verse, from masterpieces such as Paradise Lost-widely viewed as the finest epic poem in the English language-to shorter works such as the Nativity Ode, Lycidas,, A Masque and Samson Agonistes. Milton's non-English language sonnets, verses, and elegies are accompanied by fresh translations by Gordon Braden. Among the newly edited and authoritatively annotated prose selections are letters, pamphlets, political tracts, essays such as Of Educationand Areopagitica, and a generous portion of his heretical Christian Doctrine. These works reveal Milton's passionate advocacy of controversial positions during the English Civil War and the Commonwealth and Restoration periods.
With his deep learning and the sensual immediacy of his language, Milton creates for us a unique bridge to the cultures of classical antiquity and medieval and Renaissance Christianity. With this in mind, the editors give careful attention to preserving the vibrant energy of Milton's verse and prose, while making the relatively unfamiliar aspects of his writing accessible to modern readers. Notes identify the old meanings and roots of English words, illuminate historical contexts-including classical and biblical allusions-and offer concise accounts of the author's philosophical and political assumptions.

8467502,1,US,true,3.8,"John Milton's Paradise Lost is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.
Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.

16668421,2,US,true,4.34,"In ""Practicing to Walk Like a Heron"" multiple-award-winning Michigan poet Jack Ridl shares lines of well-earned wisdom in the face of a constantly changing world. The familiar comforts of life-a warm fire in winter, a lush garden in summer-become the settings for transcendent and universal truths in these poems, as moments of grief, sadness, and melancholy trigger a deeper appreciation for small but important joys. The simple clarity of Ridl's lines and diction make the poems accessible to all readers, but especially rewarding for those who appreciate carefully honed, masterful verse.
Many of the poems take solace in nature-quiet deer outside in the woods, deep snow, a thrush's empty nest in the eaves-as well as man-made things in the world-a steamer trunk, glass jars, tea cups, and books piled high near an easy chair. Yet Ridl avoids becoming nostalgic or romantic in his surroundings, and shows that there is nothing easy in his celebration of topics like ""The Letters,"" ""But He Loved His Dog,"" ""A Christmas List for Santa,"" and ""The Enormous Mystery of Couples."" An interlude of full-color pages divides Ridl's more personal poems with a section of circus-themed pieces, adding visions of elephants, trumpets, tents, sequins, and sideshows, and the uniquely travel-weary perspectives of jugglers, trapeze artists, roustabouts, and clowns.

13634016,13,US,true,3.83,"The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem in dactylic hexameter, traditionally attributed to Homer. Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.
----
Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 - 30 May 1744) was an 18th-century English poet. He is best known for his satirical verse, as well as for his translation of Homer. Famous for his use of the heroic couplet, he is the second-most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, after Shakespeare.
Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the Iliad. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which brought him two hundred guineas (PS210) a volume, equivalent to about PS27,900 in 2015, a vast sum at the time.
His translation of the Iliad appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by Samuel Johnson as ""a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal"" (although the classical scholar Richard Bentley wrote: ""It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer."").",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13634016-the-iliad-of-homer-translated-by-alexander-pope,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13634016-the-iliad-of-homer-translated-by-alexander-pope,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440018783m/13634016.jpg,77,3293141,"The Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope","The Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope"

In this collection of interlinked stories, these dragons are unbound by standard cliches. These dragons live among us, taking our forms, drinking our food, breeding with our bloodlines...nobody knew their families dwelled in the stars, awaiting for a time to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. When cruelty and greed pulled the last straw, they attacked with technology superior to our own. Welcome to The Society, and we're running for our lives. 
The world has seen many anomalies. From the passage of the space dragons, to the formation of Crotonians, Planet Earth is in for a good ass-kicking. When the God of Dragons becomes angered at the torture his children endure, his mind is sent into a frenzy of apocalyptic proportions, leading him to summon the rest of his dragonian family from the depths of space. When a young dragonboy wanders into a city of seemingly nice people, he becomes the subject of their dark desires. And the bond of a teenage girl and the auspicious dragon god is tested when she becomes the apple of Perch Tech's illegal experimentation.
Follow the adventures of a wide cast of characters as they encounter the dragons of the Draconizica empire, and Ashuton Karrucci, the god of dragons going about his daily life in Italy. From a story about a small town of dragons ravaged by an airborn virus, to a story about a dragon king on a terraformed Mars, to the story of a girl pregnant with a Dragon god, to the story of a boy born from a tangerine. All of this and more in this book of three hundred stories and poems taking place in a world full of anomalies.
Warning: may cause sleepless nights, slight trauma, online debates about the plausibility of space dragons, might anger some people, might gross out the weak, might make pedophiles scream, might make racists tear their hair out, might make poetry enthusiasts die of excitement, might cause multiple spasms and is definitely not intended for the weak of heart, unless you eat tomatoes.

Already weakened in spirit by Guinevere's infidelity with the now-exiled Lancelot, Arthur must rouse his knights to battle one last time against Mordred's rebels and foreign mercenaries.

In his eleventh full-length book, Muldoon reminds us that he is a traditional poet who is steadfastly at odds with tradition. If the poetic sequence is the main mode of Maggot, it certainly isn't your father's poetic sequence. Taking as a starting point W. B. Yeats's remark that the only fit topics for a serious mood are ""sex and the dead,"" Muldoon finds unexpected ways of thinking and feeling about what it means to come to terms with the early twenty-first century. It's no accident that the centerpiece of Maggot is an outlandish meditation on a failed poem that draws on the vocabulary of entomological forensics. The last series of linked lyrics, meanwhile, takes as its subject the urge to memorialize the scenes of fatal automobile accidents. The extravagant linkage of rot and the erotic is at the heart of not only the title sequence but also many of the round songs that characterize Maggot, and has led Angela Leighton, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, to see these new poems as giving readers ""a thrilling, wild, fairground ride, with few let-ups for the squeamish.""",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22962620-maggot,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22962620-maggot,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,3,12650337,Maggot: Poems,Maggot: Poems

Ours is such a time, and rising to the challenge, novelist and poet Fanny Howe suggests new and fruitful ways of thinking about both the artist's role and the condition of doubt. In these original meditations on bewilderment, motherhood, imagination, and art-making, Howe takes on conventional systems of belief and argues for another, brave way of proceeding. In the essays ""Immanence"" and ""Work and Love"" and those on writers such as Carmelite nun Edith Stein, French mystic Simone Weil, Thomas Hardy, and Ilona Karmel--who were particularly affected by political, philosophical, and existential events in the twentieth century--she directly engages questions of race, gender, religion, faith, language, and political thought and, in doing so, expands the field of the literary essay. A richly evocative memoir, ""Seeing Is Believing,"" situates Howe's own domestic and political life in Boston in the late '60s and early '70s within the broader movement for survival and social justice in the face of that city's racism.

But Lenore Kandel was no muse or hanger-on; she was a brilliant lyric poet, often unabashedly erotic, and that's where her legacy lies.
Collected Poems of Lenore Kandel contains 80 examples of her art, from the ""holy erotica"" of her early years to later, more contemplative works. Many of the poems have never been published, others only in rare ephemeral publications. Some are explicit, celebrating carnal love as part of the divine. Others are humorous and cover more quotidian subjects. A recurring theme is the ""divine animal"" duality. The collection includes poems written from the early fifties up until Kandel's death.
The paradox of Lenore Kandel is that despite her prodigious talent, she was one of the least read and critically appreciated of modern poets. Kandel found her voice at a time when the Beat era was giving way to the countercultural age, and though she straddled both eras, it meant that she also fell through the cracks in terms of recognition.

By arranging the poems chronologically, Makoto Ueda has created an overview of the way in which this enigmatic seventeen-syllable form has been used and experimented with during different eras. At the same time, the reader is admitted to the often marginalized world of female experience in Japan, revealing voices every bit as rich and colorful, and perhaps even more lyrical and erotic, than those found in male haiku.
Listen, for instance, to Chiyojo, who worked in what has been long thought of as the dark age of haiku during the eighteenth century, but who composed exquisitely fine poems tracing the smallest workings of nature. Or Katsuro Nobuko, who wrote powerfully erotic poems when she was widowed after only two years of marriage. And here, too, is a voice from today, Mayuzumi Madoka, whose meditations on romantic love represent a fresh new approach to haiku.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16644070-far-beyond-the-field,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16644070-far-beyond-the-field,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355820808m/16644070.jpg,4,359213,Far Beyond the Field: Haiku by Japanese Women,Far Beyond the Field: Haiku by Japanese Women

11732999,8,US,true,3.41,"James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (1882-1941) was an Irish expatriate writer, widely considered to be one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. He is best known for his landmark novel Ulysses (1922) and its highly controversial successor Finnegans Wake (1939), as well as the short story collection Dubliners (1914) and the semi-autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). Although he spent most of his adult life outside Ireland, Joyce's fictional universe is firmly rooted in Dublin, providing the settings and much of the subject matter for all his fiction. In particular, his tempestuous early relationship with the Irish Roman Catholic Church is reflected through a similar inner conflict in his recurrent alter ego Stephen Dedalus. As the result of his minute attentiveness to a personal locale and his self-imposed exile and influence throughout Europe, Joyce became simultaneously one of the most cosmopolitan and one of the most local of all the great English language writers.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11732999-chamber-music,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11732999-chamber-music,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,61,16016021,Chamber Music,Chamber Music

It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter.[1] The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to Greco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the Iliad, composed in the 8th century BC. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas, and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues and legitimized the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes and gods of Rome and Troy.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565377-the-aeneid,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565377-the-aeneid,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,57,288738,The Aeneid,The Aeneid

Worst of all, Ivy's body won t stop expanding. She's getting taller and curvier, with no end in sight.

Christine Heppermann's collection of fifty poems puts the ideals of fairy tales right beside the life of the modern teenage girl. With piercing truths reminiscent of Laurie Halse Anderson and Ellen Hopkins, this is a powerful and provocative book for every young woman. E. Lockhart, author of We Were Liars, calls it ""a bloody poetic attack on the beauty myth that's caustic, funny, and heartbreaking.""
Cruelties come not just from wicked stepmothers, but also from ourselves. There are expectations, pressures, judgment, and criticism. Self-doubt and self-confidence. But there are also friends, and sisters, and a whole hell of a lot of power there for the taking. In fifty poems, Christine Heppermann confronts society head on.

As she carries us through the seasons when her marriage was ending, Olds opens her heart to the reader, sharing the feeling of invisibility that comes when we are no longer standing in love's sight; the surprising physical bond that still exists between a couple during parting; the loss of everything from her husband's smile to the set of his hip; the radical change in her sense of place in the world. Olds is naked before us, curious and brave and even generous toward the man who was her mate for thirty years and who now loves another woman. As she writes in the remarkable ""Stag's Leap,"" ""When anyone escapes, my heart / leaps up. Even when it's I who am escaped from, / I am half on the side of the leaver."" Olds's propulsive poetic line and the magic of her imagery are as lively as ever, and there is a new range to the music--sometimes headlong, sometimes contemplative and deep.

This new translation, by respected contemporary poet Karl Kirchwey, faithfully renders the collection's heady mix of classical learning and earthy sensuality in poems whose rhythm and rhyme represent one of the supreme accomplishments of French verse. Restoring frequently anthologized poems to the context in which they originally appeared, Poems Under Saturntestifies to the blazing talents for which Verlaine is celebrated.
The poems display precocious virtuosity, mingling the attractions of the flesh with the longings of the spirit. Greek and Hindu myth give way to intimate erotic meditations and wickedly satirical society portraits, mythological landscapes alternate with gritty narratives of mid-nineteenth century Paris, visions of happiness yield to nightmarish glimpses of deep alienation, and real and imaginary characters--including Achilles, Valmiki, Charlemagne, and Spain's baleful King Philip II--all figure as the subject matter of a supremely ambitious young poet.

My grandfather and brother died. I hid inside a black cave deep in my soul, numbed for a decade on meds, booze, and bad love, married to my glorious career.
My name is Liz Snow, from Atlanta, Georgia, and this is my story.
One hot summer I fell hopelessly in love with successful attorney, Peter William Hendrix III, from Chattanooga, Tennessee. We bonded because of Shelley and Keats. Pete introduced me to the works of modern English poet, Jack O. Savage, It was like The Poet was drawing us together through his blogs and poems, like he had a message for my life and my love with Pete Hendrix.
I lived it in my heart and soul.
It all went tragically wrong once I learned Pete's secret.
As September ends I jet to London, England with an unstable mind and a broken heart. Pete Hendrix betrayed me big time. There was no time for revenge. My life was a kaleidoscope of stabbing shards of pain.
London ignored me. Maybe I didn't exist. I was lost and lonely in a flat in Kensington. I hear that Jack O. Savage will make a rare public appearance. I wrangle an invitation to the art gallery where he is reading. I was curious. Somehow, he was the cause of my trouble. The rock-star-with-words was even more damaged than I.
Jack O.Savage, The Poet became my friend. Then, an unexpected kiss at a county fair on a perfect English summer's day changed everything forever. Jack the man became my lover.
Magic.
My elusive dream of a lifelong love began. If Pete was what I'd always wanted, Jack was what I always needed. The mystery unraveled as the kaleidoscope of my broken life evolved and I found myself living a rainbow of perfect bliss.
Sometimes when you believe it's the end, it's only the beginning.
September Ends is a contemporary romance with erotic and supernatural elements bound by poetry. It reveals the intricate web of passion and desire which entangles Liz Snow, Pete Hendrix and Jack O. Savage. The story is told through Liz Snow's diary, Jack O. Savage's poetry, and from letters sent across the Atlantic. Traveling throughout the lushness of a summertime in Tennessee and Georgia, September Ends journeys into the elegance of London's West End and is finally settled in the countryside of Cornwall, England, a decade later.

Bored and aloof, tired of St Petersburg high society, Yevgeny Onegin goes to live on the country estate he has just inherited from his uncle. There he encounters Tatyana, who becomes hopelessly infatuated with him. From this story Pushkin creates his sublime masterpiece of love, death, duelling, rivalry, identity and the search for happiness; the lodestar for all of Russian literature. By turns playful, philosophical, sardonic and mournful, brimming with rich descriptions of Russian life, from drinking and dancing to crisp wintry landscapes, Yevgeny Onegin is a work of thrilling energy. Anthony Briggs's deft and vibrant new translation brilliantly conveys this vitality, capturing all the supple lightness and humour, as well as the depth, of Pushkin's luminous verse novel. Alexander Pushkin was born in 1799. He published his first poem when he was a teenager, and in 1820 his first long poem -- Ruslan and Lyudmila --made him famous. His work, including the novel-in-verse Yevgeny Onegin, the poem The Bronze Horseman, the play Boris Goduno; and the short story 'The Queen of Spades', has secured his place as one of the greatest writers, in any language, ever to have lived.

Featuring poems scattered over nearly thirty years of writing and salvaged from the diaries 'authored' by one Sue Townsend, this slim volume features more than thirty pieces of Adrian's unique art.
From his timeless first documented poem - The Tap- via classic odes to his muse, first and only true love Pandora (I adore ya), we follow Adrian's life in verse form. We not only witness his burgeoning political anger in works like Mrs Thatcher(Do you weep, Mrs Thatcher, do you weep?) but also see in later poems his merciless examination of the hollow shell of masculinity as well as documenting his declining libido in tragic pieces like To My Organ.
For the first time in a single volume, these are the collected poems of misunderstood intellectual and tortured poet Adrian Mole.

A provocative meditation on race, Claudia Rankine's long-awaited follow up to her groundbreaking book Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.
Claudia Rankine's bold new book recounts mounting racial aggressions in ongoing encounters in twenty-first-century daily life and in the media. Some of these encounters are slights, seeming slips of the tongue, and some are intentional offensives in the classroom, at the supermarket, at home, on the tennis court with Serena Williams and the soccer field with Zinedine Zidane, online, on TV-everywhere, all the time. The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive. Our addressability is tied to the state of our belonging, Rankine argues, as are our assumptions and expectations of citizenship. In essay, image, and poetry, Citizenis a powerful testament to the individual and collective effects of racism in our contemporary, often named ""post-race"" society.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22892256-citizen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22892256-citizen,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420944208m/22892256.jpg,15,39895091,Citizen: An American Lyric,Citizen: An American Lyric

NPR'S MOST ANTICIPATED POETRY BOOKS OF 2017
A striking, full-length debut collection from Virgin Islands-born poet Nicole Sealey
The existential magnitude, deep intellect, and playful subversion of St. Thomas-born, Florida-raised poet Nicole Sealey's work is restless in its empathic, succinct examination and lucid awareness of what it means to be human.
The ranging scope of inquiry undertaken in Ordinary Beast--at times philosophical, emotional, and experiential--is evident in each thrilling twist of image by the poet. In brilliant, often ironic lines that move from meditation to matter of fact in a single beat, Sealey's voice is always awake to the natural world, to the pain and punishment of existence, to the origins and demises of humanity. Exploring notions of race, sexuality, gender, myth, history, and embodiment with profound understanding, Sealey's is a poetry that refuses to turn a blind eye or deny. It is a poetry of daunting knowledge.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33544908-ordinary-beast,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33544908-ordinary-beast,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503860179m/33544908.jpg,51,54315244,Ordinary Beast,Ordinary Beast

This beautiful volume of short fictions and poems takes as its inspiration the author's tasting of 28 different kinds of honey, one per day. Each tasting leads to a different literary creation, each entry beginning with a description of the honey in terms that will be familiar to wine connoisseurs: ""Day 3-Sag Harbor, NY, Early Spring Honey,"" which has a color ""pale and clear as snowmelt"" and the smell ""cool sugar crystals,"" but also brings to mind ""a stingless jellyfish I once held in my hand in Oman."" The taste? ""...like the end of winter...[when] you can still see clumps of snow on the ground and the air is heavy with damp...""
The differences between the types of honey allow El-Mohtar to move back and forth between the poetic and the more casually contemporary, with the experiment of the tasting as the unifying structure.

Dotheadis an exploration of selfhood both intense and exhilarating. Within the first pages, Amit Majmudar asserts the claims of both the self and the other: the title poem shows us the place of an Indian American teenager in the bland surround of a mostly white peer group, partaking of imagery from the poet's Hindu tradition; the very next poem is a fanciful autobiography, relying for its imagery on the religious tradition of Islam. From poems about the treatment of people who look like Majmudar at the airport (""my dark unshaven brothers / whose names overlap with the crazies and God-fiends"") to a long, freewheeling abecedarian poem about Adam and Eve and the discovery of oral sex, Dotheadis both a profoundly satisfying cultural critique and a thrilling experiment in language. United across a wide range of tones and forms, the poems inhabit and explode multiple perspectives, finding beauty in every one.

""In the first incarnation of The Book of Repulsive Women, Djuna Barnes writes ""[Her lips] bloom vivid and repulsive / As the truth."" 101 years later, Carrie Lorig has usurped Barnes's title to expose the contemporary repulsive woman: she is a thinker, a feeler, a poet. She is intellectual emotion, relentlessly inquisitive and just plain brutal. She exclaims, ""All reading is blood,"" and the literature she reads is ""So Polluted."" This text is blood, polluted with punctuation and form and accusative words that may as well be curses. And we are all accountable. Harkening to Barnes, Lorig declares ""There is a Devil inside me / There is a Flower inside me,"" and so we watch them both bloom and wilt and decay. We twist our faces in disgust at revelation; we squint against all that beauty."" -Lily Hoang
Excerpt:
""As soon as there is motion / a poem / As soon as there is art, the pretentious scrap / the pretentious corpse / the female occupant / the repulsive jewel you pay attention to torn and sore / She has no choice / She has no choice
when she reads.
All reading is blood.

The Vicious Ones
I was attacked viciously
By those women,
Of course, it's very hard for them
To attack me on looks,
Because I'm so good looking.
But I was attacked very viciously
By those women.
--August 9, 2015, NBC's Meet the Press
Straight from the mouth of ""the Donald"" himself, this treasury of spoken poetry--not a word is changed--has been culled from nearly 30 years of interviews, speeches, tweets, and ramblings from Presidential candidate and billionaire Donald Trump. Since the 1980s, Trump has built his verses like his casinos, using only the highest quality words and phrases, regardless of cost. He's run a real estate empire, achieved a net worth of ten billion dollars, scripted best-sellers, and starred in the top-rated TV show ""The Apprentice."" Like a colossus, he bestrides the cultural world as if it were the bottle-strewn boardwalk of Atlantic City.
But until now, Trump's poetry--delivered spontaneously in moments of enduring clarity--has gone unnoticed, (making it the only aspect of Trump to be that way.) On a regular basis, The Donald speaks, tweets and hollers his verses--always without the needless restrictions of political correctness and grammar... because among world class poets, there don't be no grammar, there only be truth... big time!
Whether you're a Trump debunker or admirer, The Bard of the Dealwill delight, shock, and entertain you. So prepare to be Trumped by the ten billion dollar poetry of the ten billion dollar bard. This is the art of the poem.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161231-bard-of-the-deal,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161231-bard-of-the-deal,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445790087m/27161231.jpg,32,47200558,Bard of the Deal: The Poetry of Donald Trump,Bard of the Deal: The Poetry of Donald Trump

16339203,2,US,true,4.45,"""The Bront s had their moors, I have my marshes,"" Lorine Niedecker wrote of flood-prone Black Hawk Island in Wisconsin, where she lived most of her life. Her life by water, as she called it, could not have been further removed from the avant-garde poetry scene where she also made a home. Niedecker is one of the most important poets of her generation and an essential member of the Objectivist circle. Her work attracted high praise from her peers--Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky, Cid Corman, Clayton Eshleman--with whom she exchanged life-sustaining letters. Niedecker was also a major woman poet who interrogated issues of gender, domesticity, work, marriage, and sexual politics long before the modern feminist movement. Her marginal status, both geographically and as a woman, translates into a major poetry. Niedecker's lyric voice is one of the most subtle and sensuous of the twentieth century. Her ear is constantly alive to sounds of nature, oddities of vernacular speech, textures of vowels and consonants. Often compared to Emily Dickinson, Niedecker writes a poetry of wit and emotion, cosmopolitan experimentation and down-home American speech. This much-anticipated volume presents all of Niedecker's surviving poetry, plays, and creative prose in the sequence of their composition. It includes many poems previously unpublished in book form plus all of Niedecker's surviving 1930s surrealist work and her 1936-46 folk poetry, bringing to light the formative experimental phases of her early career. With an introduction that offers an account of the poet's life and notes that provide detailed textual information, this book will be the definitive reader's and scholar's edition of Niedecker's work.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16339203-lorine-niedecker,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16339203-lorine-niedecker,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361422539m/16339203.jpg,14,718793,Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works,Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works

Presenting ""House,"" an original poem by Neil Gaiman in celebration of National Poetry Month on Tor.com, acquired for Tor.com by consulting editor Ellen Datlow.
""House""
Sometimes I think it's like I live in a big giant head on a hilltop
made of papier mache, a big giant head of my own head.
I polish the eyes which would be windows, or
mow the lawn, I mean this is my house we're talking about here
even if it is a big giant papier mache head that looks just like mine.
And people who go past
in cars or buses or see the house the head on the hill from trains
they think the house is me.
I'll be sleeping there, or polishing the eyes, or weeding the lawn,
but no-one will see me, no-one would look.
And no-one would ever come. And if I waved no-one even knows it was me waving.
They'd all be looking in the wrong place, at the head on the hill.
I can see your house from here.

The book's mood is best captured in the closing lines of the title poem, which takes its name from the ship that brought the poet's mother to America: A nine-year-old girl travels all night by train with one suitcase and an orange.

She, along with other political poets of the early Modernist period, has been coming under increasing critical scrutiny at the beginning of the twenty- first century. Her first book, The Ghetto and Other Poems was published in 1918. The title poem portrays the Jewish community of Hester Street New York, and deals with the effects of capitalism, gender conflict and conflicts between generations on this immigrant community in ways that bear comparison to the works of Charles Reznikoff. The book was a critical success and led to her involvement with avant-garde magazines such as Others and Broom. Although never a member of any political party, she protested against the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927.

Excerpt:
The ""Bhagavad Gita"" sometimes called ""The Lord's Lay,"" or the ""Message of the Master,"" is an episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in the Sixth (or ""Bhishma"") Parva. It enjoys the highest esteem among the Hindu people, and is constantly quoted there as a great authority regarding doctrine. Its philosophy embodies the prevailing Hindu beliefs, as expounded by the Brahmans, and in its teachings it subtly blends into a harmonious whole the varying points of doctrine of Patanjali, Kapila and of the Vedas. It is supposed to have been written by Vyasa whose personality is veiled in doubt for of the time of his existence in the world no record seems to have been kept.
To the reader who finds in this marvelous dialogue merely the record of a literal conversation dressed up in fancy by the Oriental imagination, the real beauty and purpose of the teaching is lost.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081485-the-bhagavad-gita,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081485-the-bhagavad-gita,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,3,1492580,The Bhagavad Gita,The Bhagavad Gita

Spanning five decades and comprising 868 poems (nearly 300 of which have never before appeared in book form), this magnificent volume is the definitive sampling of a writer who has been called the poet laureate of African America--and perhaps our greatest popular poet since Walt Whitman. Here, for the first time, are all the poems that Langston Hughes published during his lifetime, arranged in the general order in which he wrote them and annotated by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel.
Alongside such famous works as ""The Negro Speaks of Rivers"" and Montage of a Dream Deferred, The Collected Poemsincludes the author's lesser-known verse for children; topical poems distributed through the Associated Negro Press; and poems such as ""Goodbye Christ"" that were once suppressed. Lyrical and pungent, passionate and polemical, the result is a treasure of a book, the essential collection of a poet whose words have entered our common language.

So begins one of the greatest works of literature in any language. Written by the Roman poet Virgil more than two thousand years ago, the story of Aeneas' seven-year journey from the ruins of Troy to Italy, where he becomes the founding ancestor of Rome, is a narrative on an epic scale: Aeneas and his companions contend not only with human enemies but with the whim of the gods. His destiny preordained by Jupiter, Aeneas is nevertheless assailed by dangers invoked by the goddess Juno, and by the
torments of love, loyalty, and despair. Virgil's supreme achievement is not only to reveal Rome's imperial future for his patron Augustus, but to invest it with both passion and suffering for all those caught up in the fates of others.
Frederick Ahl's new translation echoes the Virgilian hexameter in a thrillingly accurate and engaging style. An Introduction by Elaine Fantham, and Ahl's comprehensive notes and invaluable indexed glossary complement the translation.

Peer is a dreamer, liar, excellent storyteller and an irresponsible person who avoids all problems. He uses and discards women and looks towards the grandiose, the unattainable. Despite of this, one can't help but like and feel sorry for Peer, as it is easy to recognize something of yourself in him.
Peer Gynt is the most well known Norwegian play throughout history and is based loosely on the folklore about Per Gynt.

25407594,1,US,true,4.17,"Dear Lover -poems of love, loss, and disappointment, shame, pride, and indifference.
Dear Lover--a poetry collection about hope and heartbreak, about love in its short, long, and temporary forms, about how love can be cloaked in abuse, how love can build us or break us, the hard and soft of it, the good, the bad, and the completely atrocious.
The collection is a poetic story of different relationships which are organized into the stages of a relationship; that initial attraction, the circling dance around each other, the honey-moon stage, the souring, the fighting, the breaking up, and the recovering. This work is deeply personal, but relatable all the same.
Autobiographical at its core, it aims for love's failures and triumphs, its disappointments and celebrations, the bad, the good, and the downright ugly. It is a poetry collection that reaches for the hearts of anyone who has ever fallen in love, thought of falling in love, fallen out of love, or is in love with the idea of love.
Written in letter format, the collection includes a few sonnets, a couple villanelles, and a pantoum among the formal verse poetry, but mostly it is an experimentation with prose poetry and free verse that hardly seems free at times due to the skill with which the poet wields words.
Dear Lover, includes Lori Jenessa Nelson's sharp eye for detail and idea organization, as well as her ability to express these ideas using the most evocative language, and effective, if not always proper, grammar. She wields the vocabularies that she has gleaned from her artistic background in a way that adds a delicious realism to even the saddest of poems.
Because love does not always come with lovers, Dear Lover, also includes a section about casual sex, because Nelson frowns severely on slut-shaming and believes in the power of sexual freedom associated with ""having sex the way that men do."" She accepts the positive and negative that comes with the act and includes her experiences in the collection.
Love is not always easy and that's what this poetry attempts to communicate.

From the celebrated poet Yrsa Daley-Ward, a poignant collection of poems about the heart, life, and the inner self.
Bone. Visceral. Close to. Stark.
The poems in Yrsa Daley-Ward's collection bone are exactly that: reflections on a particular life honed to their essence--so clear and pared-down, they become universal.
From navigating the oft competing worlds of religion and desire, to balancing society's expectations with the raw experience of being a woman in the world; from detailing the experiences of growing up as a first generation black British woman, to working through situations of dependence and abuse; from finding solace in the echoing caverns of depression and loss, to exploring the vulnerability and redemption in falling in love, each of the raw and immediate poems in Daley-Ward's bone resonates to the core of what it means to be human.

Voyager is an inspirational and transformational work that conveys the inexpressible truth of existence -- we are pure awareness at centre, human in appearance. There is a world behind the world. It shines for all. 
There is a light that shines beyond all things on earth, beyond the highest, the very highest heavens. This is the light that shines in your heart. --Chandogya Upanishad
We are voyagers, set on a course to find our unique purpose and the miracle inside us. In the very heart of humanity is the key to true peace and happiness. Each of the twenty-five chapters presents a voyage toward our inner, True Self, bringing a deeper and wider perspective along the way. Exploring the shores of human-beingness ever more deeply, we realise Soul is the lighthouse -- the light that guides us safely home. By simply experiencing ourselves without distraction of mind, we see through personal drama to our inner true nature. We are all connected in the still ocean of pure awareness.
It is only the mind which appears as the world and as bondage; there is no world other than the mind. On inquiry, this mind turns out to be nothing more than ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness. --The Ribhu Gita
Pure awareness is an art that requires practice to quiet the surface of mind and still the moving waters of our emotional seas. Awakening is recognising all world appearances are illuminated from the light that shines in our heart.
We stand at the bow of our ship. The sky is clear, the sea is calm.

When she refuses, he is driven to thoughtless desperation: a bottle of sleeping pills, a bottle of whisky. And in his dying dream, he revisits that theme park of childish desire.
There he finds the landscape - still garish and indulgent - has evolved. The attractions are religion, money and sex. The characters - costumed and acted - are transformed into Jefferson, Xunzi, Aristotle. And their purpose is to instruct Patrick in the pursuit of happiness throughout human history.
But Patrick can only answer with his own story. He remembers falling in love with Louise. Recalls the enlightenment of their youth and the banality of their family life. He tells of their marriage, how it came under strain after the birth of his son; how he cheated; the unravelling of all his joy. Yet still his love persists.

She, along with other political poets of the early Modernist period, has been coming under increasing critical scrutiny at the beginning of the twenty- first century. Her first book, The Ghetto and Other Poems was published in 1918. The title poem portrays the Jewish community of Hester Street New York, and deals with the effects of capitalism, gender conflict and conflicts between generations on this immigrant community in ways that bear comparison to the works of Charles Reznikoff. The book was a critical success and led to her involvement with avant-garde magazines such as Others and Broom. Although never a member of any political party, she protested against the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927.

26699940,3,US,true,4.14,"""Howl"" is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1955, published as part of his 1956 collection of poetry titled ""Howl and Other Poems."" Ginsberg began work on ""Howl"" as early as 1954. ""Howl"" is considered to be one of the great works of American literature. It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation, which included Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. There is no foundation to the myth that ""Howl"" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense's case during the poem's obscenity trial, as detailed below.

24854610,1,US,true,4.38,"Alberto Caeiro foi, como admitiu muitas vezes Fernando Pessoa, um dos seus heteronimos que mais gostava e admirava. Foi criado quando um dia Fernando Pessoa se lembrou de fazer uma partida ao seu amigo, o escritor Mario de Sa-Carneiro, mandando-lhe um poema e dizendo que era de um suposto conhecido. Quando finalmente pos a descoberto a mentira disse-lhe por carta:
""Quis inventar um poeta bucolico, de especie complicada, e apresentar-lho, ja me nao lembro como, em qualquer especie de realidade. Levei uns dias a elaborar o poeta mas nada consegui. Num dia em que finalmente desistira -- foi em 8 de Marco de 1914 -- aproximei-me de uma comoda alta, e, tomando um papel, comecei a escrever, de pe, como escrevo sempre que posso. E escrevi trinta e tantos poemas a fio, numa especie de extase cuja natureza nao conseguirei definir. Foi o dia mais triunfal da minha vida, e nunca poderei ter outro assim. Abri com um titulo, ""O Guardador de Rebanhos"". E o que se seguiu foi o aparecimento de alguem em mim, a quem dei desde logo o nome de Alberto Caeiro. Desculpa-me o absurdo da frase: ""aparecera em mim o meu mestre"" mas foi essa a sensacao imediata que tive.""
Em mais detalhes, Fernando Pessoa escreveu que o imaginou como tendo nascido em Lisboa, em 1889 e morrido em 1915, mas que viveu quase toda a sua vida no campo, com uma tia-avo idosa, porque tinha ficado orfao de pais cedo. Era louro, de olhos azuis. Como educacao, apenas tinha tirado a instrucao primaria e nao tinha profissao.
Fernando Pessoa diria ainda que, quando escrevia em nome de Caeiro, fazia-o ""por pura e inesperada inspiracao, sem saber ou sequer calcular que iria escrever.""
Como poeta, Alberto Caeiro apresenta-se como um simples ""guardador de rebanhos"" que escreve sobre a natureza e so se importa em ver de forma objetiva e natural a realidade. Ao mesmo tempo despreza e repreende qualquer tipo de pensamento filosofico, afirmando que pensar obstrui a visao (""pensar e estar doente dos olhos"").
E pois um poeta de extrema simplicidade que considera que a sensacao e a unica realidade e que refletir sobre como as coisas sao e entrar num mundo complexo, desnecessario e problematico onde tudo e incerto e obscuro.
Fernando Pessoa chamava-o de ""Mestre Ingenuo"" e considerava-o o maior dos seus heteronimos.

Questo libro lo ho intitolato ""Le mie poesie, le vostre emozioni"" perche sono convinto che la poesia non viva nei suoi versi ma nelle emozioni di chi la legge.
Scopo delle poesie e trasmettere delle emozioni e sono queste ultime a rendere una poesia bella o meno.
Da questa mia convinzione e nata l'idea di pubblicare le mie poesie assieme alle impressioni dei lettori.
Attraverso il mio blog ho raccolto i commenti dei lettori e ne ho selezionati alcuni che ho messo a corredo delle poesie.
Ho voluto anche fornire un mio commento personale sulle poesie, una sorta di approfondimento del messaggio che ho voluto trasmettere e di spiegazione di alcuni passaggi che secondo me meritavano menzione.
Questo libro e il secondo di una collana di tre volumi che ho intitolato ""L'amore e poesia"". Il primo libro della collana intitolato ""Quello che devi sapere"" e stato scritto da me quando ero un adolescente ed e rivolto ad una ragazza della quale mi ero innamorato. Puo essere utile a coloro che vogliono contestualizzare le poesie d'amore riportate in questo secondo volume.
Le poesie proposte sono di vario genere ma principalmente sono poesie d'amore.
Per darvi una idea riporto alcuni versi:
""L'armonia
L'armonia della tua persona
e come il fluire dell'acqua in un torrente.
E' limpida , e serena, e cortese, e delicata,
e porta un'ondata di benessere e piacere.""
""Il Cigno
Un cigno adagiato sulle acque di un lago
e assorto nel suo passato.
Non se ne accorge e la corrente lo trascina
ma lui pensa e con la mente e alla deriva.""
""La prateria
Un mare di erba vive sotto i miei occhi,
e le rondini in balia del vento ne solcano le onde
alla ricerca del pasto diurno.""
""Cosi come ti vedo
Quando ti guardo dritto negli occhi
mi sembra di trovarmi in un'altra dimensione
dove tutto e possibile, dove tutto e bello;
e tu sei la regina di questo regno incantato.""
""L'amore che provo per te
Era un sentimento represso nel mio cuore.
Non riusciva a librarsi nell' aria e a raggiungere le vette della felicita.
Era tormentato perche incerto e immaturo.""
""Malinconica speranza
Il mio essere mi si rivela
solo quando nel mio cuore scende la sera.
Il buio non mi fa vedere
quello che vorrei capire.""

The world of Beauty/Beauty is 'built from the nose/out, like a painting', accumulating its various feelings, ideas, objects, disappointments and joys to the point of almost overflowing. Preoccupied with demise and loss, as well as reimagination and regeneration, Rebecca Perry's debut collection has the duality and symmetry of its title at its core. Beauty/Beauty is a book with tenderness running through its veins, exploring salvation, reparation and the fullness of being alive; the difficulty of defining what love is, the heartbreak, the faraway friends, the overwhelming abundance of things in museums. It is alive with memories, with old loves hanging around in the corners of dark rooms, ghost mouths hidden inside the mouth you are kissing, and eulogies to dearly departed pets. Each poem creates its own tiny world to be lived in and explored; a stegosaurus is adored, a million silver spiders play dead, a list of flowers is not really a list of flowers, adorable dogs want to be friends, the flightless grow wings, and the stars turn green. 'Rebecca Perry's Beauty/Beauty is, immediately, a vivid and charming book - but it is also doing something new. Its readers will find that Perry has invented and made her own a kind of poem which seems to have a white fracture in it, a formal manoeuvring that accentuates the tenderness and intelligence of this remarkable debut.

Part of an ancient Hindu epic poem, the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita takes place on a battlefield, where a war for the possession of a North Indian kingdom is about to ensue between two noble families related by blood. The epic's hero, young Prince Arjuna, is torn between his duty as a warrior and his revulsion at the thought of his brothers and cousins killing each other over control of the realm. Frozen by this ethical dilemma, he debates the big questions of life and death with the supreme Hindu deity Krishna, cleverly disguised as his charioteer. By the end of the story, Eastern beliefs about mortality and reincarnation, the vision and practice of yoga, the Indian social order and its responsibilities, family loyalty, spiritual knowledge, and the loftiest pursuits of the human heart are explored in depth. Explaining the very purpose of life and existence, this classic has stood the test of twenty-three centuries.

19008715,1,US,true,4.39,"Este ebook presenta ""Obras completas de Gustavo Adolfo Becquer "", con un indice dinamico y detallado. Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, el poeta espano, es uno de los ultimos representantes del romanticismo del siglo XIX. Cobro reconocimiento luego de su muerte cuando vieron la luz muchas de sus obras. Un claro ejemplo fue su libro ""Rimas"", que se perdio en 1868 y gracias a su memoria y las publicaciones donde algunas ya habian aparecido, pudo reconstruir su obra mas famosa, que termino lanzandose junto a sus ""Leyendas"" en 1871, a un ano de su desaparicion fisica, como gesto de sus amigos para ayudar a su familia.Aunque en vida ya alcanzo cierta fama, solo despues de su muerte y tras la publicacion del conjunto de sus escritos alcanzo el prestigio que hoy se le reconoce.La poesia de Becquer En contraste con los romanticos de 1840, el tono de Becquer es menos retorico y pomposo, y mas intimista y melancolico. En sus famosas Rimas, el poeta puso hincapie en la palabra desnuda y depurada. Para Becquer la poesia era sentimiento, no artificio. Sus versos muestran una clara influencia de Heinrich Heine, poeta romantico aleman, pero tambien del cantar popular andaluz con su queja desgarrada, y voz directa, dramatica y honda. De hecho, Becquer escribio algunos cantares y un amigo suyo les puso musica de soleares y seguidillas. Becquer preferio el verso libre a la metrica medida, y la asonancia a la consonancia. En su poesia destacan como temas: la naturaleza y el arte como simbolos de la emocion; la fugacidad del amor; el pesimismo; la belleza y el misterio del universo. La prosa de Becquer Si bien Becquer se conoce principalmente por sus versos, tambien escribio mas de 20 leyendas. Estos relatos fantasticos se caracterizan por el misterio y lo sobrenatural, temas goticos, la religiosidad, lo exotico pero tambien lo costumbrista, paisajes naturales, y la epoca medieval. Tambien escribio ensayos, articulos periodisticos y critica literaria",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19008715-obras-completas-de-gustavo-adolfo-b-cquer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19008715-obras-completas-de-gustavo-adolfo-b-cquer,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,2,1121965,Obras completas de Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer,Obras completas de Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer
36403877,2,US,true,4.66,"""The struggle from late youth on, with and without God, agony, narcotics and love is a torment rarely recorded with such sustained eloquence and passion as you will find in this collection."" --Fanny Howe
This highly-anticipated debut boldly confronts addiction and courses the strenuous path of recovery, beginning in the wilds of the mind. Poems confront craving, control, the constant battle of alcoholism and sobriety, and the questioning of the self and its instincts within the context of this never-ending fight.
""In Calling a Wolf a Wolf, Kaveh Akbar exquisitely and tenaciously braids astonishment and atonement into a singular lyric voice. The desolation of alcoholism widens into hard-won insight: 'the body is a mosque borrowed from Heaven.' Doubt and fear spiral into grace and beauty. Akbar's mind, like his language, is perpetually in motion. His imagery--wounded and resplendent--is masterful and his syntax ensnares and releases music that's both delicate and muscular. Kaveh Akbar has crafted one of the best debuts in recent memory. In his hands, awe and redemption hinge into unforgettable and gorgeous poems."" --Eduardo C.

The Divine Comedy (Italian: Divina Commedia [di'vi:na kom'me:dja]) is an epic poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308 and completed 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. On the surface, the poem describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven; but at a deeper level, it represents, allegorically, the soul's journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy and the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas.Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called ""the Summa in verse"". The work was originally simply titled Comedia and the word Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio. The first printed edition to add the word divina to the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce,[8] published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28076833-divine-comedy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28076833-divine-comedy,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,27,809248,Divine Comedy: Illustrated Platinum Edition (Free Audiobook Included),Divine Comedy: Illustrated Platinum Edition (Free Audiobook Included)

The poetry of Nikki Giovanni has spurred movements and inspired songs, turned hearts and informed generations. She's been hailed as a healer and a national treasure. But if her reputation is writ large upon the national stage, her heart resides in the everyday where family and lovers gather, friends commune, and those no longer with us are remembered.
And at every gathering there is food, food as sustenance, food as aphrodisiac, food as memory. A pot of beans are flavored with her mother's sighs, this sigh part cardamom, that one the essence of clove; a lover requests a banquet as an affirmation of ongoing passion; an homage is paid to the most time-honored appetizer, soup.

To tell the dramatic and tragic story of one man s pact with the Devil in exchange for knowledge and power, Goethe drew from an immense variety of cultural and historical material, and a wealth of poetic and theatrical traditions. What results is a tour de force illustrating Goethe s own moral and artistic development, and a symbolic, cautionary tale of Western humanity striving restlessly and ruthlessly for progress. Capturing the sense, poetic variety, and tonal range of the German original in present-day English, Stuart Atkins s translation presents the formal and rhythmic dexterity of ""Faust"" in all its richness and beauty, without recourse to archaisms or interpretive elaborations.

18948055,2,US,true,4.31,"Siegfried Loraine Sassoon (1886-1967) who wrote under the pseudonyms Pinchbeck Lyre, Sigma Sashun and George Sherston was an English poet and author. He became known as a writer of satirical anti-war verse during World War I, but later won acclaim for his prose work. Sassoon was born in the village of Matfield, Kent, to a Jewish father and a Protestant English mother. He studied both law and history from 1905 to 1907 however, he dropped out of university without a degree and spent the next few years hunting, playing cricket, and privately publishing a few volumes of not very highly acclaimed poetry. Sassoon joined the military just as the threat of World War I was realised. He soon became horrified by the realities of war, and the tone of his writing changed completely. Sassoon's periods of duty on the Western Front were marked by exceptionally brave actions. The war had brought Sassoon into contact with men from less advantaged backgrounds, and he had developed Socialist sympathies. Amongst his famous works are The Daffodil Murderer (1913), The Old Huntsman (1917), Counter-Attack and Other Poems (1918), Picture-Show (1919) and The War Poems (1919).",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18948055-counter-attack-and-other-poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18948055-counter-attack-and-other-poems,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,25,1885127,Counter-Attack and Other Poems,Counter-Attack and Other Poems

Breathturn into Timestead: TheCollected Later Poetry gathers the five final volumes of his life's work in a bilingual edition, translated and with commentary by the award-winning poet and translator Pierre Joris.
This collection displays a mature writer at the height of his talents, following what Celan himself called the ""turn"" (Wende)of his work away from the lush, surreal metaphors of his earlier verse. Given ""the sinister events in its memory,"" Celan believed that the language of poetry had to become ""more sober, more factual . . . 'grayer.'"" Abandoning the more sumptuous music of the first books, he pared down his compositions to increase the accuracy of the language that now ""does not transfigure or render 'poetical'; it names, it posits, it tries to measure the area of the given and the possible."" In his need for an inhabitable post-Holocaust world, Celan saw that ""reality is not simply there; it must be searched for and won.""

Excerpt:
The ""Bhagavad Gita"" sometimes called ""The Lord's Lay,"" or the ""Message of the Master,"" is an episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in the Sixth (or ""Bhishma"") Parva. It enjoys the highest esteem among the Hindu people, and is constantly quoted there as a great authority regarding doctrine. Its philosophy embodies the prevailing Hindu beliefs, as expounded by the Brahmans, and in its teachings it subtly blends into a harmonious whole the varying points of doctrine of Patanjali, Kapila and of the Vedas. It is supposed to have been written by Vyasa whose personality is veiled in doubt for of the time of his existence in the world no record seems to have been kept.
To the reader who finds in this marvelous dialogue merely the record of a literal conversation dressed up in fancy by the Oriental imagination, the real beauty and purpose of the teaching is lost.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22236919-the-bhagavad-gita,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22236919-the-bhagavad-gita,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,34,1492580,The Bhagavad Gita,The Bhagavad Gita

And these relationships are in turn basic to, and may stand for, our relationship to God and to the sustaining mysteries and powers of creation.""

18299542,21,US,true,4.05,"According to Wikipedia: ""William Blake (28 November 1757-12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. His prophetic poetry has been said to form ""what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language"". His visual artistry has led one British art journalist to proclaim him ""far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced"". Although he only once journeyed farther than a day's walk outside London during his lifetime, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich corpus, which embraced the imagination as ""the body of God"", or ""Human existence itself"". Considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, Blake is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterized as part of both the Romantic movement and ""Pre-Romantic"", for its large appearance in the 18th century. Reverent of the Bible but hostile to the Church of England, Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions, as well as by such thinkers as Jakob Bohme and Emanuel Swedenborg.""",Kindle Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18299542-poems-of-william-blake,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18299542-poems-of-william-blake,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1375889429m/18299542.jpg,608,12932457,Poems of William Blake,Poems of William Blake

A still beautiful woman, 31 years old with four children by a faithless lover, cannot break the habit of expectation. She must learn to submit to the cold, bare, unglamorous tenets of reality - the untenable position of love. She must learn to deflect Grand Passion into an acceptance of the rogues and rascals with their radiant faces, who buy her a bitter with borrowed cash. Out of a passionate youth, through pain and harsh revelation, she has attained a maturity - a certain knowledge that the cost of rapture is high and that there is no looking back.

The stories in Hot Water Musicdash around the worst parts of town - a motel room stinking of sick, a decrepit apartment housing a perpetually arguing couple, a bar tended by a skeleton - and depict the darkest parts of human existence. Bukowski talks simply and profoundly about the underbelly of the working class without raising judgement.

19059974,3,US,true,4.07,"In Memoriam is Tennyson's tribute to his friend Arthur Henry Hallam who died at the age of 22, written over a period of 17 years.
The original title of the poem was ""The Way of the Soul"", and this might give an idea of how the poem is an account of all Tennyson's thoughts and feelings as he copes with his grief over such a long period, including wrestling with the big philosophico-scientific questions of his day. It is perhaps because of this that the poem is still popular with and of interest to modern readers. Owing to its length and its arguable breadth of focus, the poem might not be thought an elegy or a dirge in the strictest formal sense.
The poem is not arranged exactly in the order in which it was written. The prologue, for example, is thought to have been one of the last things written. Critics believe, however, that the poem as a whole is meant to be chronological in terms of the progression of Tennyson's grief. The passage of time is marked by the three descriptions of Christmas at different points in the poem, and the poem ends with a description of the marriage of Tennyson's sister.
""In Memoriam"" is written in four-line ABBA stanzas of iambic tetrameter, and such stanzas are now called In Memoriam Stanzas. Though not metrically unusual, given the length of the work, the meter creates a tonal effect which often divides readers - is it the natural sound of mourning and grief, or merely monotonous? The poem is divided into 133 cantos (including the prologue and epilogue), and in contrast to its constant and regulated metrical form, encompasses many different subjects: profound spiritual experiences, nostalgic reminiscence, philosophical speculation, Romantic fantasizing and even occasional verse. The death of Hallam, and Tennyson's attempts to cope with this, remain the strand that ties all these together.

20017056,1,US,true,3.42,"The design of the projector of this volume was, that it should contain the Best of the shorter humorous poems in the literatures of England and the United States, except: Poems so local or cotemporary in subject or allusion, as not to be readily understood by the modern American reader; Poems which, from the freedom of expression allowed in the healthy ages, can not now be read aloud in a company of men and women; Poems that have become perfectly familiar to every body, from their incessant reproduction in school-books and newspapers; and Poems by living American authors, who have collected their humorous pieces from the periodicals in which most of them originally appeared, and given them to the world in their own names. Holmes, Saxe, and Lowell are, therefore, only REPRESENTED in this collection. To have done more than fairly represent them, had been to infringe rights which are doubly sacred, because they are not protected by law. To have done less would have deprived the reader of a most convenient means of observing that, in a kind of composition confessed to be among the most difficult, our native wits are not excelled by foreign. The editor expected to be embarrassed with a profusion of material for his purpose. But, on a survey of the poetical literature of the two countries, it was discovered that, of really excellent humorous poetry, of the kinds universally interesting, untainted by obscenity, not marred by coarseness of language, nor obscured by remote allusion, the quantity in existence is not great. It is thought that this volume contains a very large proportion of the best pieces that haveappeared. An unexpected feature of the book is, that there is not a line in it by a female hand. The alleged foibles of the Fair have given occasion to libraries of comic verse; yet, with diligent search, no humorous poems by women have been found which are of merit sufficient to give them claim to a place in a collection like this. That lively wit and graceful gayety, that quick perception of the absurd, which ladies are continually displaying in their conversation and correspondence, never, it seems, suggest the successful epigram, or inspire happy satirical verse",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20017056-the-humourous-poetry-of-the-english-language,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20017056-the-humourous-poetry-of-the-english-language,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,1,16433555,The Humourous Poetry of the English Language,The Humourous Poetry of the English Language

Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett.at the age of nine.Engraved by G. Cooke from a Drawing by Charles Hayter. London: Published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 15. Waterloo Place. PREFATORY NOTE. 1. ""Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Edward Moulton Barrett, was born in London on the 4th of March, 1809."" Elizabeth was born, March 6, 1806, at Coxhoe Hall, county of Durham, the residence of her father.[A] ""Before she was eleven she composed an epic on 'Marathon.'"" She was then fourteen. 2. ""It is said that Mr. Barrett was a man of intellect and culture, and therefore able to direct his daughter's education, but be that so or not, he obtained for her the tutorial assistance of the well-known Greek scholar Hugh Stuart Boyd ... who was also a writer of fluent verse: and his influence and instruction doubtless confirmed Miss Barrett in her poetical aspirations."" Mr. Boyd, early deprived of sight from over-study, resided at Malvern, and cared for little else than Greek literature, especially that of the ""Fathers."" He was about or over fifty, stooped a good deal, and was nearly bald. His daily habit was to sit for hours before a table, treating it as a piano with his fingers, and reciting Greek--his memory for which was such that, on a folio column of his favourite St. Gregory being read to him, he would repeat it without missing a syllable. Elizabeth, then residing in Herefordshire, visited him frequently, partly from her own love of Greek, and partly from a desire for the congenial society of one to whom her attendance might be helpful. There was nothing in the least ""tutorial"" in this relation--merely the natural feeling of a girl for a blind and disabled scholar in whose pursuits she took interest. Her knowledge of Greek was originally due to a preference for sharing with her brother Edward in the instruction of his Scottish tutor Mr. M'Swiney rather than in that of her own governess Mrs. Orme: and at such lessons she constantly assisted until her brother's departure for the Charter House--where he had Thackeray for a schoolfellow. In point of fact, she was self-taught in almost every respect. Mr. Boyd was no writer of ""fluent verse,"" though he published an unimportant volume, and the literary sympathies of the friends were exclusively bestowed on Greek",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168065-the-poetical-works-of-elizabeth-barrett-browning,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168065-the-poetical-works-of-elizabeth-barrett-browning,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,0,844614,The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning,The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning

13547706,2,US,true,3.89,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Triangles comes an exquisitely told story about a young woman torn between passionate first love and the gripping realities of war.
Meet Ashley, a graduate student at San Diego State University. She was raised in northern California reading poetry and singing backupin her best friend's band. The last thing she ever expected was to end up a military wife. But one night, she meets a handsome Marine named Cole. He doesn't match the stereotype of the aggressive military man she'd always presumed to be true; he's passionate and romantic, and he even writes poetry. Their relationship evolves into a deeply felt, sexually charged love affair that goes on for five years and survives four deployments. Cole desperately wants Ashley to marry him, but when she meets another man, a college professor, with similar professional pursuits and values, she begins to see what life might be like outside the shadow of war.
Written in Ellen Hopkins's stunning poetic verse style, Collateral captures the hearts of the soldiers on the battlefield and the minds of the friends, family, and lovers they leave behind. While those at home may be far from the relentless, sand-choked skies of the Middle East and the crosshairs of a sniper rifle, they, too, sacrifice their lives and happiness for their country at war. And all must eventually ask themselves if the collateral damage it causes is worth the fight.

La parte piu compiuta dei testi risale al periodo fiorentino (1812-1813). Si individuano in essa tre inni, introdotti dalla dedica ad Antonio Canova e da un epigrafe. Nel primo, dedicato a Venere, Foscolo racconta la nascita delle Grazie che emergono dall'acqua, guidate dalla dea della bellezza: tutta la natura rinasce e l'animo umano si libera della sua originaria ferinita. Il secondo, dedicato a Vesta, si svolge nel tempio di Bellosguardo: qui, tre sacerdotesse (sotto le cui spoglie si nascondono tre donne amate dal poeta) compiono riti in onore delle Grazie. Il terzo, dedicato a Pallade, e ambientato nell'isola di Atlantide: presenta Pallade e le altre dee che tessono un velo per proteggere le Grazie dalle passioni degli uomini, in modo che esse possano proseguire nella loro missione purificatrice.

It is perhaps the most famous and most written-about long poem of the 20th century, dealing with the decline of civilization and the impossibility of recovering meaning in life. Despite the alleged obscurity of the poem--its shifts between satire and prophecy, its abrupt and unannounced changes of speaker, location and time, its elegiac but intimidating summoning up of a vast and dissonant range of cultures and literatures--the poem has nonetheless become a familiar touchstone of modern literature.

Pollitt's imagination is stirred by conflict and juxtaposition, by the contrast (but also the connection) between logic and feeling, between the real and the transcendent, between our outer and inner selves: Jane Austen slides her manuscript under her blotter, bewildered young mothers chat politely on the playground, the simple lines of a Chinese bowl in a thrift store remind the poet of the only apparent simplicities of her childhood. The title poem hilariously and ruefully depicts the friction between passion and repression (""Perhaps / my body would have liked to make some of our dates, / to come home at four in the morning and answer my scowl / with 'None of your business!' ""). In a sequence of nine poems, Pollitt turns to the Bible for inspiration, transforming some of the oldest tales of Western civilization into subversive modern parables: What if Adam and Eve couldn't wait to leave Eden? What if God needs us more than we need him?
With these moving, vivid, and utterly distinctive poems, Katha Pollitt reminds us that poetry can be both profound and accessible, and reconfirms her standing in the first rank of modern American poets.

During his lifetime, Roussel's work was vociferously championed by the surrealists, but never achieved the widespread acclaim for which he yearned. New Impressions of Africais undoubtedly Roussel's most extraordinary work. Since its publication in 1932, this weird and wonderful poem has slowly gained cult status, and its admirers have included Salvador Dali--who dubbed it the most ""ungraspably poetic"" work of the era--Andre Breton, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, Michel Foucault, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery.
Roussel began writing New Impressions of Africain 1915 while serving in the French Army during the First World War and it took him seventeen years to complete. ""It is hard to believe the immense amount of time composition of this kind of verse requires,"" he later commented. Mysterious, unnerving, hilarious, haunting, both rigorously logical and dizzyingly sublime, it is truly one of the hidden masterpieces of twentieth-century modernism.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson, cast his interpretation of Arthurian myth into the form of an epic poem, and his tales of Camelot soar to remarkable imaginative heights to trace the birth of a king; the founding, fellowship, and decline of the Round Table; and the king's inevitable departure. Encompassing romance, heroism, duty, and conflict, Tennyson's poetry charts the rise and fall of a legendary society.
""The Coming of Arthur"" chronicles the victorious battle with which the king also wins Guinevere's hand; ""Gareth and Lynette,"" ""The Marriage of Geraint,"" and ""Geraint and Enid"" likewise concern tests and triumphs of love, virtue, and valor.

19216906,1,US,true,3.99,"Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly re-create the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the poetry of the originals.
Aeschylus' Oresteia, the only ancient tragic trilogy to survive, is one of the great foundational texts of Western culture. It begins with Agamemnon, which describes Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War and his murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra, continues with her murder by their son Orestes in Libation Bearers, and concludes with Orestes' acquittal at a court founded by Athena in Eumenides. The trilogy thus traces the evolution of justice in human society from blood vengeance to the rule of law, Aeschylus' contribution to a Greek legend steeped in murder, adultery, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and endless intrigue. This new translation is faithful to the strangeness of the original Greek and to its enduring human truth, expressed in language remarkable for poetic intensity, rich metaphorical texture, and a verbal density that modulates at times into powerful simplicity. The translation's precise but complicated rhythms honor the music of the Greek, bringing into unforgettable English the Aeschylean vision of a world fraught with spiritual and political tensions.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19216906-the-oresteia,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19216906-the-oresteia,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,5,2378,The Oresteia (Complete Aeschylus 1: Greek Tragedy in New Translations),The Oresteia (Complete Aeschylus 1: Greek Tragedy in New Translations)

Excerpts:
THAT SUMMER AFTERNOON
That summer was not easy on us
But one afternoon the clouds came
And the shadows gave way to quiet light
As we walked to the park half regretting
Having cursed the heat
We were tired of summer, and afraid of winter
Lying by me, you read a book, occasionally
Turning your head to see what I was doing
But I was reading too
And I would bend over to your side
And kiss you lightly on the head
It was a quiet summer afternoon, and
We had all life can offer
The rest being vanity and excess
I flipped a page and turned to you
To kiss you on the head
It was the last of that hot summer
But winter would be warm
A DOG IS A MAN'S BEST FRIEND
Should you peek
At the fugitive
Picture of death?
How will you face
Your death
If it is not sudden?
And will your dog
Ever bark
At your corpse
Deceased?
Or will it be at ease
As if you threw it a bone
That was once your own?",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17185398-lessness-and-more,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17185398-lessness-and-more,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356643430m/17185398.jpg,3,21802759,Lessness and More,Lessness and More

In it, Nadler imagines himself into those moments of unintelligibility--that blank space in between things--where constraint and expansion coincide. These poems, translations of work that does not otherwise exist, are intended to fill the invented or actual lacunae in manuscripts of classical Indian poetry. When faced with such ellipses, like where a few decisive hieroglyphs have worn off a wall, he infers and reconstructs the flora, fauna, and pleasures of an ancient world.
""Like the wind that gusts coastal pines toward the water / sleep bends me toward my lover / and I cannot drink from her"": Nadler's is a project of constant negotiation. He attends to impulses of restoration and conservation, in turns.

32494868,3,US,true,4.37,"Let Them Eat Chaos, Kate Tempest's new long poem written for live performance and heard on the album release of the same name, is both a powerful sermon and a moving play for voices. Seven neighbors inhabit the same London street, but are all unknown to each other. The clock freezes in the small hours, and one by one we see directly into their lives: lives that are damaged, disenfranchised, lonely, broken, addicted, and all, apparently, without hope. Then a great storm breaks over London, and brings them out into the night to face each other--and their own last chance to connect.

17893406,5,US,true,4.77,"The Iranian poet and painter Sohrab Sepehri (1928-1980) is revered today for many of the things he was criticized for during his lifetime. Born and raised in the ancient city of Kashan, he was educated in Tehran and travelled widely. A gentle introvert by nature, he was accused of escapism when his reaction to the world around him was to go back to nature, mysticism and mythology, poetry and painting. This mystic of the twentieth century seeks a light that radiates from the individual soul and ultimately affects its relationship with others and the world around it. While Rumi, the mystic of the thirteenth century, dances, sings, and chants out loud that he comes from the world of spirit and is a stranger in the world of matter, Sepehri, quietly aware of humanity in a milieu alien to its physical, psychological, and spiritual needs, in poetry and painting, appeared to stroke human consciousness into a tranquility, almost a state of beatitude, which nevertheless is never quite free of the ongoing struggle for ""awareness, understanding and illumination.""
Sepehri had a free and sometimes convoluted approach to the verities of life, insisting that the book of everyday ""illusions"" must be closed and ...
."".. one must rise""
""And walk along the stretch of time, ""
""Look at the flowers, hear the enigma.""
""One must run until the end of being ...""
""One must sit close to the unfolding, ""
""Some place between rapture and illumination.""

""The cat is the beautiful devil.""
Felines touched a vulnerable spot in Charles Bukowski's crusty soul. For the writer, there was something majestic and elemental about these inscrutable creatures he admired, sentient beings whose searing gaze could penetrate deep into our being. Bukowski considered cats to be unique forces of nature, elusive emissaries of beauty and love.
On Catsoffers Bukowski's musings on these beloved animals and their toughness and resiliency. He honors them as fighters, hunters, survivors who command awe and respect as they grip tightly onto the world around them: ""A cat is only ITSELF, representative of the strong forces of life that won't let go.""
Funny, moving, tough, and caring, On Catsbrings together the acclaimed writer's reflections on these animals he so admired. Bukowski's cats are fierce and demanding--he captures them stalking their prey; crawling across his typewritten pages; waking him up with claws across the face. But they are also affectionate and giving, sources of inspiration and gentle, insistent care.
Poignant yet free of treacle, On Catsis an illuminating portrait of this one-of-a-kind artist and his unique view of the world, witnessed through his relationship with the animals he considered his most profound teachers.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24606050-on-cats,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24606050-on-cats,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426363673m/24606050.jpg,652,44216022,On Cats,On Cats

They include Alexandrian papyri, some dating from as early as the 1st century BC, and manuscripts written from the eleventh century forward. He wrote a poem of some 800 verses, the Works and Days, which revolves around two general truths: labour is the universal lot of Man, but he who is willing to work will get by. Tradition also attributes the Theogony, a poem which uses the same epic verse-form as the Works and Days, to Hesiod. A short poem traditionally attributed to Hesiod is The Shield of Heracles.

Voyager is an inspirational and transformational work that conveys the inexpressible truth of existence -- we are pure awareness at centre, human in appearance. There is a world behind the world. It shines for all. 
There is a light that shines beyond all things on earth, beyond the highest, the very highest heavens. This is the light that shines in your heart. --Chandogya Upanishad
We are voyagers, set on a course to find our unique purpose and the miracle inside us. In the very heart of humanity is the key to true peace and happiness. Each of the twenty-five chapters presents a voyage toward our inner, True Self, bringing a deeper and wider perspective along the way. Exploring the shores of human-beingness ever more deeply, we realise Soul is the lighthouse -- the light that guides us safely home. By simply experiencing ourselves without distraction of mind, we see through personal drama to our inner true nature. We are all connected in the still ocean of pure awareness.
It is only the mind which appears as the world and as bondage; there is no world other than the mind. On inquiry, this mind turns out to be nothing more than ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness. --The Ribhu Gita
Pure awareness is an art that requires practice to quiet the surface of mind and still the moving waters of our emotional seas. Awakening is recognising all world appearances are illuminated from the light that shines in our heart.
We stand at the bow of our ship. The sky is clear, the sea is calm.

A booklet found by the protagonist of Z213: EXIT during the course of his voyage, The First Death tells the story of a marooned man on a desert island - or has him tell it. In a sequence of fourteen sections the crippled protagonist struggles for his survival. Through an inexhaustible fecundity of imagery and a sense of unquenchable vitality in the midst of denial and despair a relentless fight develops between the character and the elements, as well as his physical and mental disintegration. Lyacos brings to bear a formidable culture in which fragments of ancient Greek are embedded in a supple modern idiom, and a variety of classical and biblical references are seamlessly integrated into the text. The violence and intensity of his vision combined with the headlong energy of his verse reveal a tragic inner landscape.

33652557,3,US,true,3.8,"""Katie Longofono's collection Angeltitsis a magnificent look into modern personhood--especially when that personhood revolves around the identity of being a woman--or female-bodied. It questions gender stereotypes and why humans interact in such a closeted, emotionally violent way. In her poem 'We Are Mostly Merciful,' it begins with sage lines: 'We are mostly merciful we give in/we say uncle relatively speaking/it's easy not like sifting flour/or kneading,' and then powerfully ends with the line: 'women walking between/familiar rooms.'""
-Joanna Valente
""Angeltitscomes in real as the blood of a cut lip in a kiss, 'a sweet red decanted/ on their tongues.' Here, Longofono, in strong boned poems by turns quiet and loud with pain and sex, defies objectification, and in so doing, reclaims her subjectivity. In her aubade 'One Morning, Every Morning,' Longofono's speaker becomes a poem: 'you break but can't explain/where. You'd call yourself a shell/except it evokes the cage/of something pink and tough which is true/but you also mean how often/you are a single line.' This work voices the unspoken moments, musky with sex and violence, in which women are portrayed and betrayed, reduced, and replies, 'I am not a bird or a symbol. / I am a woman burning.'""
-Marina Weiss
""In her electrified, electrifying poems, Katie Longofono writes lines that spark with anger, hurt, and intelligence.

Pushcart Prize nominee Ash Krafton opens this volume with a piece that leaves the reader wondering: Is the speaker victim or victor? Shadows can obscure the details that would cement our perceptions of individuals or events. Sometimes, shadows tell us more than we want to know.
Shadows prevail in each of the poems in The Scent of his Feathers, but Krafton is not afraid of the dark. In this poetry collection, she explores the darkness that surrounds us, dimming the edges of our well-lit worlds. Themes of death, devotion, despair, and desperation are expressed in subtle shades, allowing the reader to determine their own definitions.
How a person interprets these pieces--a collection of tiny everyday deaths--will depend on the reader and the flavor of the shadows within that person's heart. Join Krafton as she explores the inherent beauty of twilight. Sympathize with the shadows of a soul. Understand what drives a spirit to desperation.

The result is a daring, delicate, unguarded, and tender collection. After his last three books--Touch, Blackbird and Wolf, and Middle Earth--in which the sonnet was a thrown shape and not merely a template, Cole's buoyant new poems seem trim and terse, with a forthright, clear-eyed moral gaze. In their sorrowful richness, they combine a susceptibility to sensuousness and an awareness of desolation.

As a young woman, threatened by disturbing visions, Arvio went into psychoanalysis to save herself. The result is a riveting sequence of dream poems, followed by ""Notes."" The poems, in the form of irregular sonnets, describe her dreamworld: a realm of beauty and terror emblazoned with recurring colors and images--gold, blood red, robin's-egg blue, snakes, swarms of razors, suitcases, playing cards, a catwalk. The Notes, also exquisitely readable, unfold the meaning of the dreams--as told to her analyst--and recount the enlightening and sometimes harrowing process of unlocking memories, starting with the diaries she burned to make herself forget. Arvio's explorations lead her back to her younger self--and to a life-changing understanding that will fascinate readers.

24340727,8,US,true,3.93,"FURIES brings together a collection of writers from around the world, uniting their voices in a powerful chorus that challenges and changes the status quo...an exquisite, compelling read."" The Skinny
This is the poetry of wronged and revolutionary women, the new verse that emerges when poets take a sinner and spin her anew. Here, Furies arise from history and myth to set the story straight once and for all. For many, the Lazarus trick spans only the space of a verse in which they tell their tale. The rest of the resurrection, the living on beyond the page, relies on the reader to keep telling and retelling, and then telling once more. Traditionally, ghosts haunt because they still have something left to say. This is their stage.
FURIES is the first poetry collection from For Books' Sake, compiled following an open call for submissions that attracted over 700 entries from across the globe, resulting in an anthology of incredible, powerful poetry from some of the world's most exciting emerging and established women writers.
The FURIES poetry anthology is edited by Eve Lacey, and includes a foreword from Jenni Fagan, acclaimed author of The Panopticon. All profits from the collection (a minimum of PS5 per copy) will be donated to Rape Crisis England & Wales.
FURIES features both emerging and established voices, including published and prize-winning authors from Imtiaz Dharker to Rebecca Goss to Patience Agbabi.
Within these pages you'll find some of the best women's writing out there today, united in celebration of women warriors past, present and future.
To be voiceless is to question whether one even exists -- so listen to these voices -- for all of those who cannot speak out and for all those who are waiting to hear these words and know them as their own; to all those who understand that rape is a war we must all continue to challenge and fight in every country, every day, from now until the human race finally, truly, evolves. Until then -- let it be known that we stood side-by-side on the long road home and said, enough is enough.

33302196,1,US,true,4.33,"In Cry Foul the Blink of a Watchman, Russell J. Dorn takes readers for an often somber, sometimes joyful, and occasionally humorous ride through the teenage years and early twenties of an introspective young American man. Written as a private catharsis of remorse, lost love, and guilt, Dorn opens up this dark collection of poems for others to read for the first time, in hopes readers might find common feelings, shared experiences, life between the lines, and occasional bits of beauty. Topics such as blame, loneliness, inequality, relationships, and depression, as well as more fantastical themes such as werewolves, mermaids, folklore, romance, and Mountain Dew are within. Sharp and unapologetically brutal on issues of anxiety, unrequited love, religion, and human nature, this collection doesn't shy away from tough or haunting topics.
The poem settings take place in a stark landscape of the cold desert of northern Nevada, as well as in landscapes of the poet's imagination. Here we take a look through the crack in the mirror to glimpse the other crooked side in order to explore perspectives, psychology, and doubt. Here also is an examination of life in Reno, a twenty-four seven, casino town and the surrounding valleys. These poems from the creator of Felipe Femur the Skeleton and his ironic monster friends transport the reader into the complex adult landscape under the skin--the bones of the matter, the underlying structure. Gain insight to the mind that created the Halloween town of Toonstone with these often gloomy verses too poignant for the faint of heart. Honest to the core, Russell J. Dorn never dilutes or dulls the sharpness of his words.
A chapbook of forty-nine poems from over a decade and a prose introduction to bind them together in their categories of remorse, perspective, love lost, and trust. Poems range from silly to serious. The poetry anthology encourages acceptance of change and moving forward as a person and as a society. The four sections, These Skeletal Remains, Intact; A Crack in the Reflection; Drown in the Shallow Sea; and The Blink of a Watchman relate to remorse, perspective, love & loss, and trust, respectively.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33302196-cry-foul-the-blink-of-a-watchman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33302196-cry-foul-the-blink-of-a-watchman,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,3,54036101,Cry Foul the Blink of a Watchman,Cry Foul the Blink of a Watchman

A quasi quattrocento anni dalla morte di Shakespeare, le sue commedie continuano a essere rappresentate in tutto il mondo, e conservano immutato il loro valore archetipico per il teatro moderno. Cio vale sia per le opere in cui e il gioco di parola a tenere banco, l'intreccio della bella retorica a incantare la platea piu dell'intreccio delle storie (e il caso delle commedie cosiddette ""eufuistiche"": La bisbetica domata, La commedia degli errori, I due gentiluomini di Verona, Pene d'amor perdute, Sogno di una notte di mezza estate), sia per quella sorta di romance visionario e drammatico de La tempesta e per il Racconto d'inverno; per le commedie romantiche, ispirate a una ricercata leggerezza (Come vi piace, La dodicesima notte, Le allegre comari di Windsor), per i drammi a lieto fine (Tutto e bene quel che finisce bene e Misura per misura), per le opere alle quali si e addirittura associata la definizione di tragicommedie (Il mercante di Venezia e Molto rumore per nulla). C'e un filo rosso che lega questa imponente e immortale produzione, ed e quello del Genio.
William Shakespeare
nacque a Stratford on Avon nel 1564. Nel 1592 era gia conosciuto come autore di teatro e fra il 1594 e il 1595 vennero rappresentati almeno quattro suoi drammi. Ormai faceva parte dell'importante compagnia del Lord Ciambellano, che godra di ininterrotto favore a Corte, prendendo sotto Giacomo I il nome di King's Men. Ad essa Shakespeare dedichera tutta la sua attivita di drammaturgo. Mori il 23 aprile del 1616. La Newton Compton ha pubblicato: Amleto, Antonio e Cleopatra, La bisbetica domata, Come vi piace, Giulio Cesare, Il mercante di Venezia, Misura per misura, Molto rumore per nulla, Otello, Romeo e Giulietta, Sogno di una notte di mezza estate, Re Giovanni, Re Lear, Troilo e Cressida, Tutto e bene quel che finisce bene in volumi singoli; Tutto il teatro, Le grandi tragedie e Le commedie in volumi unici.",Paperback,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19273691-le-commedie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19273691-le-commedie,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,1,41539,Le commedie,Le commedie

26258235,1,US,true,4.66,"One of the most engaging voices contemporary spirituality in is that of the Irish poet, Padraig O'Tuama. This second poetry collection arises out of a decade of his hearing stories of people who have lived through personal and political conflict in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and other places of conflict. These poems tell stories of individuals who have lived through conflict: their loves and losses, their hope and generosity. One poem, 'Shaking hands' was written when Padraig witnessed the historic handshake between Queen Elizabeth II and Martin McGuinness, who has since used the poem publicly.

""for the love of black girls"" makes visible the pain and magic that is growing up a black girl in America by recalling her own coming-of-age story and chanting that black women are present, lovable and anything but invisible.
Reviews:
""I know I am alive and important enough to live forever because Tatiana's poems suggest I am so. Her work exists on a plane that is innately spiritual, black and female. She pours into me a sweetness that is unparalleled; one that breaks open parts of me and allow other parts to feel whole. Each line break and choice in diction sparks a jolt that reverberates long after I've left Johnson's work. Her words remind me of cool morning dew on grass; naturally beautiful, deeply intricate, and designed only by god. Enjoy.""

""Tatiana M.R. Johnson's poetry reclaims the language of faith, so often melded into something reductive against the body. Johnson says we give birth to ourselves, again. again and throughout this collection she does that again and again. She ends on the poem ""Psalm for black girls"" where she says breathe in this truth of yourself and suddenly, somewhere, there are bells ringing. Do you hear them? She did that. Her forms build upon and call to each other while still leaving room for surprise. There is a femme strength emphasized here, the implication of the christian Madonna and then the reveal of the poet's self as her own Madonna. Her own Black femme magic making a new church. This book is a realm where the love of the self is the only prayer, and sisterhood is the holiest spirit. I am thankful for the Black women in my life, how they fight for everyone while the world pushes against them. I am thankful for the love Black girls give. I am thankful for Tatiana M.R. Johnson, whose voice is a hymn, arms open. I never want to stop listening.""
- Jess Rizkallah, author of ""the magic my body becomes""
""There is a power in naming, in setting the record straight, in saying this is and was not what happened to you; that ultimately, you are not a product of circumstance, not an inherited history, but rather a ""forever haunting,"" an ""ever-evolving-black girl,"" ""all the beauty in yourself."" Tatiana Johnson's ""for the love of black girls"" sets the record straight. These are poems to liberate, to extol, to recognize the beauty of black girls and of black girlhood, ever shinning, ever beautiful, ever true. Tatiana Johnson writes again and again into the moments where the world sought to render black girlhood an inadequacy, and finds beauty within herself. This is a must read.""

With her emotionally raw and deeply resonant third collection, Live or Die, Anne Sexton confirmed her place among the most celebrated poets of the twentieth century. Sexton described the volume, which depicts a fictionalized version of her struggle with mental illness, as ""a fever chart for a bad case of melancholy."" From the halls of a psychiatric hospital--""the scene of the disordered scenes"" in ""Flee on Your Donkey""--to a child's playroom--""a graveyard full of dolls"" in ""Those Times . . .""--these gripping poems offer profound insight on the agony of depression and the staggering acts of courage and faith required to emerge from its depths.
Along with other confessional poets like Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell, Sexton was known for grappling with intimate subjects traditionally considered taboo for poetry such as motherhood, menstruation, and drug dependence. Live or Diefeatures these topics in candid and unflinching detail, as Sexton represents the full experience of being alive--and a woman--as few poets have before.

8763590,2,US,true,4.15,"The Prayer is a drawing of the curtain, an invitation to a secret place that is discovered and explored. . . .
According to tradition and the testimony of Sufi mystics, The Prayer--or Salat--was first taught by the angels, who themselves practiced it in celestial adoration. The Prayer is God's gift to all humankind, and in this gorgeously illustrated volume, its simple, archetypal practice unfolds like a fragrant, many-petaled flower, joining words and movements into a single luminous event that engages our entire being.
These ancient rituals are presented here as a gift for anyone with a heartfelt desire to set aside for a moment the concerns of every day and enter a sacred time and space in which to explore the beckonings of the spirit. The authors take us through the words, movements, and hidden meanings of the Call to Prayer, the Ablutions, The Prayer itself, and the Peaceful Embrace afterwards. Faithful practice lends a sacred rhythm to each day and creates a psychological force that helps us nurture and express a profound inner harmony.
This first, marvelously accessible interpretation of The Prayer also offers a compelling introductin to the wisdom and teachings of the beloved contemporary Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who brought new life to this mystical tradition by opening a passage to its deepest, universal realities. It is the loving handiwork of two of Bawa's best-known students, Coleman Barks and Michael Green, who also created The Illuminated Rumi.
Like a jewel given extra brilliance by its setting, The Prayer is surrounded by the wisdom and understanding of the thirteenth-century Sufi master Rumi, whose generous poetry has become an essential canon for modern-day seekers in the West. The final gift is the Primeval Kalima, the core practice and most profound teaching of the Sufi, the ""open secret"" that leads to Divine Luminous Wisdom.

of his life. So he sustains his native land ...'
Virgil's affectionate poem of the land does not admit brief excerpts, any more than the labour of the farmer can easily be shortened. His verse, descriptive and narrative, brings us the disappointments as well as the rewards of the countryman's year-round devotion to his crops, his vines and olives, livestock great and small, and the complex society of bees.

What part of you have you suppressed, keeping it buried so deep inside that you almost forgot what is most important to you? Almost. As you read the poetic ramblings something stirs inside, your foot starts to tap, and you can hardly sit still. Maybe you turn on some music and dance into this new feeling, moving your hips as thoughts roam your head.
From Wild Woman Waking:
""broken smiles surrounding you
listening to ghostly secrets
desires of the heart
prisoner to your life
woman wake up and dance""
You grab your notebook and pen and begin to write. You realize you can't sit still anymore because your eyes are wide open. Wild Woman Waking will have you looking at things differently and hopefully taking action for yourself.
Wild Woman Waking: ""Sleeping isn't possible once you explore the inner and outer world of poetry; transformation happens and your eyes open wide.""
If you grew up trying to be what other's wanted and never sure who you really were or are, now you can choose to live and embrace your inner wild woman and maybe you will be inspired to write poetry of your own!

The narrator in Thomas Heise's adventurous novel tries to fuse together his present and past, abandonment by his parents, childhood in an orphanage, and a strong sense of disconnection from his adult life. The story is written in columnar, densely lyrical sections, looping and vertiginously dropping into the speaker's past, across several cities in Europe. W.G. Sebald, Samuel Beckett, and Michelangelo Antonioni's films come to mind, especially ""L'Avventura"" and ""Red Desert."" Heise's language is precise (dirigibles ""no larger than a fennel seed"") and his lush, unfolding sentences offer a great, gorgeous pleasure. ""Moth"" is a haunting, one-of-a-kind novel that will stay with the reader for a long, long time.

""Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien composed his own version, now published for the first time, of the great legend of Northern antiquity, in two closely related poems to which he gave the titles The New Lay of the Volsungs and The New Lay of Gudrun.
""In the Lay of the Volsungs is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fafnir most celebrated of dragons, whose treasure he took for his own; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild who slept surrounded by a wall of fire, and of their betrothal; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In that court there sprang great love but also great hate, brought about by the power of the enchantress, mother of the Niflungs, skilled in the arts of magic, of shape-changing and potions of forgetfulness.
""In scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, of Gunnar the Niflung and Gudrun his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands of his blood-brothers, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrun. In the Lay of Gudrun her fate after the death of Sigurd is told, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers the Niflung lords, and her hideous revenge.
""Deriving his version primarily from his close study of the ancient poetry of Norway and Iceland known as the Poetic Edda (and where no old poetry exists, from the later prose work the Volsunga Saga), J.R.R. Tolkien employed a verse-form of short stanzas whose lines embody in English the exacting alliterative rhythms and the concentrated energy of the poems of the Edda.""

8180179,2,US,true,4.17,"Playfulness, spare elegance, and wit epitomize the poetry of Billy Collins.""""With his distinct voice and accessible language, America's two-term Poet Laureate has opened the door to poetry for countless people for whom it might otherwise remain closed.
Like the present book's title, Collins's poems are filled with mischief, humor, and irony, ""Poetry speaks to all people, it is said, but here I would like to address / only those in my own time zone""-but also with quiet observation, intense wonder, and a reverence for the everyday: ""The birds are in their trees, / the toast is in the toaster, / and the poets are at their windows. / They are at their windows in every section of the tangerine of earth-the Chinese poets looking up at the moon, / the American poets gazing out / at the pink and blue ribbons of sunrise.""
Through simple language, Collins shows that good poetry doesn't have to be obscure or incomprehensible, qualities that are perhaps the real trouble with most ""serious"" poetry: ""By now, it should go without saying / that what the oven is to the baker / and the berry-stained blouse to the drycleaner / so the window is to the poet.""
In this dazzling new collection, his first in three years, Collins explores boyhood, jazz, love, the passage of time, and, of course, writing-themes familiar to Collins's fans but made new here. Gorgeous, funny, and deeply empathetic, Billy Collins's poetry is a window through which we see our lives as if for the first time.

Exploring his past with humor and astounding insight, Connor reminded his fans of why they first fell in love with him on YouTube--and revealed to newcomers how he relates to his millions of dedicated followers.
Now, two years later, Connor is ready to bring to light a side of himself he's rarely shown on or off camera. In this diary-like look at his life since A Work In Progress, Connor talks about his battles with clinical depression, social anxiety, self-love, and acceptance; his desire to maintain an authentic self in a world that values shares and likes over true connections; his struggles with love and loss; and his renewed efforts to be in the moment--with others and himself.

Ants on the Melonincludes poems that concern the author's childhood, that explore sensuality in candid terms, that starkly treat her husband's suicide and her own blindness, and that explore both her own emotional landscape and the universal mysteries of the human condition. Technically brilliant, using strict, classical prosody, yet entirely modern in sensibility, Virginia Adair's poetry will play a central role in the ongoing American poetry renaissance.

""Rios delivers another stunning book of poems, rich in impeccable metaphors, that revel in the ordinariness of morning coffee and the crackle of thunderous desert storms. In one sonnet, Rios addresses injustice in the borderlands, capturing with mathematical precision the everyday struggles that many migrants face--'The border is an equation in search of an equals sign.' A series of sonnets about desert flora abounds with fantastic, magical imagery--'Bougainvilleas do not bloom--they bleed' and 'Apricots are eggs laid in trees by invisible golden hens.' Likewise, Rios's bestiary sonnets overflow with inimitable similes, worthy of a book unto themselves--'Minnows are where a river's leg has fallen asleep' and 'Gnats are sneezes still flying around.' This robust volume is the perfect place to start for readers new to Rios and a prize for seasoned fans.""--Booklist
In his thirteenth book, Alberto Rios casts an intense desert light on the rich stories unfolding along the Mexico-US border. Peppered with Spanish and touches of magical realism, ordinary life and its simple props--morning showers, spilled birdseed, winter lemons--becomes an exploration of mortality and humanity, and the many possibilities of how lives might yet be lived.
Mad Honey
Made from magnificent rhododendron, poisonous rhododendron,
Very difficult-to-pronounce rhododendron--whatever
Rhododendron even is--I would have to look it up myself,
This word sounding puffed up, peacocky with its
Indianapolisly-long spelling, all those letters moving in and out.
But the plant itself, the plant and the bees that find it:
The bees see in its purple flower, first, a purple flower.
They do not spell it. They do not live in fear of quizzes,
Purple offering what it has to offer, unapologetic, without further
Definition, purple irresistible to the artist's and to the bee's eye--
Who can blame either one this first-grade impulse toward love?
Purple, always wearing something low-cut . . .

From the celebrated poet Yrsa Daley-Ward, a poignant collection of poems about the heart, life, and the inner self.
Bone. Visceral. Close to. Stark.
The poems in Yrsa Daley-Ward's collection bone are exactly that: reflections on a particular life honed to their essence--so clear and pared-down, they become universal.
From navigating the oft competing worlds of religion and desire, to balancing society's expectations with the raw experience of being a woman in the world; from detailing the experiences of growing up as a first generation black British woman, to working through situations of dependence and abuse; from finding solace in the echoing caverns of depression and loss, to exploring the vulnerability and redemption in falling in love, each of the raw and immediate poems in Daley-Ward's bone resonates to the core of what it means to be human.
""You will come away bruised.
You will come away bruised
but this will give you poetry.""

The book begins . . .
August 4, 1989
Meeting Our Neighbors
As I stooped in my driveway for the morning paper, a delegation of geese hissing like punctured tires flat-footed it toward me across the grass. This was not a social call. My new house squatting on their land beside their lake was an outrage. Indignant to their pinfeathers the geese closed ranks and delivered their ultimatum in a furious chorus.
Bills hard as chisels,
tails aquiver,
necks recoiling like missile launchers
firing off fierce glares
the posse bristles pigeon-toed
to enforce goose law:
Trespassers
will be hissed
until
they learn their lesson.
Over time we humans near the lake have made peace with the geese which, on a busy day, outnumber us twenty to one. Our key concession is to their occasional messy forays into our yards. These Canadians don't know about their ancestors, those hardy enforcers of goose law that established goose rights in the neighborhood. It's always hardest for the pioneers. The lake lacks an official name but I call it Goose Lake. It seems fair.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13477447-goose-lake-a-year-in-the-life-of-a-lake,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13477447-goose-lake-a-year-in-the-life-of-a-lake,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,3,19008200,"Goose Lake, a Year in the Life of a Lake","Goose Lake, a Year in the Life of a Lake"

That you and all your men
Were soldiers to her heart's desire,

You saw the league-long rampart-fire

32616162,3,US,true,3.92,"With its thirty interconnected poems, this book is a relatively brief work in contrast to the monumental two hundred pages of her first poetry book Este suelo secreto (1995). But here her poems feel less restrained than before, like she's allowing herself more room after her two previous, more tightly controlled poetry books.
Whereas in Este suelo secreto Parra employed a sort of second person experimental sonnet form, which she would adhere to closely for a number of pages then rupture at the next turn with a two line poem or one that explodes in fragments across the page, and whereas in Antiguedad del frio (2000) she worked with lines that were longer, almost prose-like, written now in first person and more connected by meaning and by proximity, in Aun no we feel at once closer to her than before, owing to her consistent use of a first person narrative voice full of questions and longing, even as her experimentation with visual space - by scattering words and pieces of lines across the page, by using clipped, quick stanzas - opens up distance between Parra and the reader and gives us another world, a new dimension, of readings.

20800545,1,US,true,4.16,"In this fourth collection by the popular Lee (Book of My Nights), timely immigration issues drive such poems as Self-Help for Fellow Refugees, but Lee swiftly folds them into broader inquiries about inheritance, memory and loss: you'll remember your life, he advises, as a book of candles,/ each page read by the light of its own burning. Lee's late father appears in the light of his evangelical Christian beliefs, his mother and sister as cherished links to childhood. Biblical allusions enliven an otherwise spare verbal world, while aphorisms and spiritual advice strike a note reminiscent of Rumi: Every wise child is sad.... Every wind-strewn flower is God tearing God. Rarely subtle, Lee can nevertheless be concise: every line bears the weight of long meditation, sometimes even of wisdom. Virtues of the Boring Husband, the longest piece, is one of Lee's best: a discourse on the nature of love--ponderous but shot through with golden truths--that comes from the mouth of the sheepish partner who admits, Whenever I talk, my wife falls asleep./ So now, when she can't sleep, I talk. Lee's ringing clarity and his compelling life story have brought him uncommonly loyal readers: this volume should swell their ranks.

In June of 1979, May Sarton answered the questions of two filmmakers and read to them from her poetry. This four-day ""jam session"" ultimately became an acclaimed documentary about her life and work.
For Sarton, the muse has always been female, and the writer says that her own poems ""tell me where to go."" In this rare and inspiring window into a singular woman's soul, Sarton speaks candidly about everything from how a single image opened the door to writing about her mother to the importance of transparency in art and life. She shares insights into her very personal art, including the unusual people and events that provide inspiration, how creativity can grow out of pain, solitude as a two-edged sword, the difficulties of being a female poet, and the ways love can open ""the door into one's own secret and . . . frightening real self.""
Featuring sections entitled ""On Inner Space,"" ""On Nature,"" and ""On Love,"" this revealing volume is also about the need go on, even when up against overwhelming odds.

As a teacher and translator of Irish verse, Frank O'Connor brought to the world's attention many fine poems from his native land, few as enduring--and none as controversial--as Brian Merriman's The Midnight Court.
An eighteenth-century masterpiece widely recognized as the greatest comic poem in Irish literature, The Midnight Court is a hilarious and insightful take on the battle of the sexes. In the court of a fairy queen, the men and women of Ireland air their grievances with one another. The competing lists of complaints are as long as they are uproarious, and when the queen rules in favor of the women, all young Irish bachelors are doomed to a terrible fate: marriage.
The Midnight Court has now taken its rightful place in the Irish literary canon, but when O'Connor's English translation was first published in 1945, the Irish government banned it as obscene. In a delicious irony that might have been lifted from one of O'Connor's short stories, the Gaelic original met with no censure. Here, as it first appeared, is Frank O'Connor's faithful, funny, and eloquent translation of one of the most important works in Irish literature.",ebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22812582-the-midnight-court,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22812582-the-midnight-court,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406222990m/22812582.jpg,2,42361163,The Midnight Court: And Other Poems,The Midnight Court: And Other Poems

L'intera esistenza e sogno, caratterizzata quindi da illusorieta, fugacita del tempo, vanita delle cose terrene.
